These considerations suggest an obvious direction for the next iteration of the MDGs.
"First, a new global compact should focus more directly on rich countries’ responsibilities."
"Second, it should emphasize policies beyond aid and trade that have an equal, if not greater, impact on poor countries’ development prospects."
A short list of such policies would include: carbon taxes and other measures to ameliorate climate change; more work visas to allow larger temporary migration flows from poor countries; strict controls on arms sales to developing nations; reduced support for repressive regimes; and improved sharing of financial information to reduce money laundering and tax avoidance.
"Notice that most of these measures are actually aimed at reducing damage – for example, climate change, military conflict, and financial crime – that otherwise results from rich countries’ conduct."
“Do no harm” is as good a principle here as it is in medicine.
This kind of reorientation will not be easy. Advanced countries are certain to resist any new commitments.
"But most of these measures do not cost money, and, as the MDGs have shown, setting targets can be used to mobilize action from rich-country governments."
"If the international community is going to invest in a bold new public-relations initiative, it might as well focus on areas where the potential payoffs are the greatest."
After the Promised Land
"LONDON – At the height of the Arab uprisings last spring, many Europeans were gripped by nightmare visions of a tsunami of migrants crashing against the continent’s shores."
"The wave never hit, but its specter fed a tenacious anti-immigrant populism that has concealed an important new trend: migration to Europe – and to the United States – has largely stalled."
"In many countries, more immigrants are leaving than are arriving, owing mainly to the economic crisis that has drained jobs in the West."
"That reversal is one of the great under-reported stories of 2011 (and of the preceding two years), and the numbers are startling."
"Consider Spain, which is on track to lose more than a half-million residents by 2020."
"By contrast, between 2002 and 2008, Spain’s population grew by 700,000 a year, driven largely by immigration."
The trends are similar elsewhere in Europe.
"While this fact alone will not quiet opponents of immigration, it does give countries more breathing room to repair and strengthen badly broken systems for receiving and integrating newcomers."
"Although rapidly aging Western countries are unable to attract the immigrants they need, they allow millions who are already there to suffer discrimination and abuse."
Detentions and deportations take place under sometimes terrible conditions.
"Meanwhile, the international community collectively fails to protect vast populations of vulnerable migrants, such as the millions stranded by the recent conflicts in North Africa."
"Undoubtedly, rising anti-immigrant populism must be confronted."
"While polling suggests that attitudes are influenced more by ethnicity than religion, both help to define identities and mindsets."
"Political parties in France, Switzerland, and the Netherlands (to name a few) have run successful campaigns that scapegoat immigrants."
"Moreover, governments from Alabama to Hungary are passing laws that undermine what should be migrants’ rights."
Italy recently adopted harsh “emergency” decrees that target migrants by making undocumented entry and residence a criminal offense.
Anti-immigrant rhetoric from the political extremes has fed into mainstream political discourse.
"European leaders trip over themselves to declare, one more forcefully than the next, that multiculturalism is dead."
"Dutch politician Geert Wilders, whose Freedom Party is informally part of the governing coalition, did them one better by being charged with incitement to anti-Muslim hatred."
"In the US, alligator-filled moats and electrified border fences have featured in the current presidential campaign."
"Such attacks on immigration might offer some instant political gratification, but their net result is to cleave societies whose cohesion is already seriously challenged by the economic crisis."
"Growing discrimination in employment, housing, and education affects not just immigrants and their children; it harms our societies as a whole."
"With the lull in net immigration, we now have a window of opportunity to address these shortcomings."
"Debunking the myths about migration – that most immigrants enter unlawfully, for example, or that immigration displaces existing workers – would be a good place to start."
It would also be useful to explain that immigration is necessary for prosperity and growth in almost all OECD countries.
"If aging societies in the West and elsewhere (like Japan) fail to get immigration right, they will be woefully unprepared when they confront the real tidal wave: the retirement of baby boomers in the coming two decades."
The gaps in these countries’ labor markets – from software specialists to physicians to home health aides – will be immense.
"The European Union’s labor force will decline by almost 70 million workers in the next 40 years; in the absence of significant net immigration (combined with a much higher retirement age), European economies and social safety nets will shrivel."
The priorities are clear.
"We need to understand better how our economies will evolve in the coming decades, and to redesign our educational systems to produce workers with usable skills."
"And, where it is clear that immigrants will be needed, we must be able to identify, welcome, integrate, and protect them."
"Meanwhile, our most fundamental institutions – schools, police, and the courts – must be re-engineered to reflect and respond to the diversity of our communities, which is now a fact of life."
"Countries must learn to work together to achieve these goals, few of which can be reached by going it alone."
"If our toolbox were empty, our inaction might be understandable."
But examples of smart migration practices abound.
"Canada and the Philippines, for instance, have a well-functioning accord that protects the rights of temporary workers."
Sweden has developed legislation that minimizes bureaucracy for companies that need foreign workers.
And important advances have been made in ensuring that immigrant children receive the education that they need to become full members of society.
"Progress is being made on the global level as well, despite the economic crisis and populist headwinds."
"In June, the International Labor Organization’s member states overwhelmingly approved the Domestic Workers Convention, which will significantly increase protections for a vulnerable group of workers –&nbsp;the majority of whom are migrants."
"Meanwhile, the Global Forum on Migration and Development, established in 2007, has quickly become an important means of fostering knowledge and partnerships."
"The reason for growing international cooperation is simple: countries everywhere are affected by migration, and, increasingly, they are experiencing immigration and emigration simultaneously."
"Indeed, roughly one-third of migrants nowadays move between developed countries; one-third move between developing countries; and only one-third move from the developing to the developed world."
"Highly skilled workers, such as bankers and engineers, are flocking to China."
"Mexico, known primarily as a country of emigration, is home to millions of migrants from Central America."
"Millions of people in Southeast Asia venture to the Middle East to work, but millions more cross borders within the region."
The list goes on.
"When it comes to migration, we are all in the same boat – and that boat is leaking."
"Starting in 2012, countries should redouble their efforts to fix it."
After the Taliban
``Failed state'' is a term applied frequently to Afghanistan and is often deemed the cause for why terrorists gained such influence there.
"But a country does not fail of its own volition, nor is it weakened by unknown causes."
"A country fails, when it fails, for definite, identifiable reasons."
These must be addressed if Afghanistan is to be revived.
"Twenty years of invasion, civil war, and drought have left Afghanistan's institutions in ruin."
Millions of Afghans huddle in refugee camps or are displaced from their homes.
Land-mines defile the countryside.
Millions are sick and poor; many live at starvation levels.
"For these and many other reasons, rebuilding Afghanistan's economy will require not only economic reconstruction but an effort to reinvent the country's political and cultural institutions."
"Such a massive effort will be doomed to failure, however, if Afghanistan's neighbors intervene in ways that promote economic upheaval all over again."
Afghanistan is no place for quick fixes.
Rebuilding the country cannot be done cheaply.
Any thought that the anti-terror coalition will be able to bail out fast (as the West did when it abandoned Afghanistan to its fate after the Soviet withdrawal ten years ago) should be forgotten.
The West must stick with Afghanistan until its reconstruction is established.
"Otherwise, it runs the risk of renewed chaos and violence, but this time in a more destabilized region, as Pakistan's current problems demonstrate."
"Three problems are of immediate concern, the most important being feeding the Afghan people - both within the country and in refugee camps outside Afghanistan."
"Humanitarian aid is being delivered, but a distribution system safe from the predations of Afghanistan's warlords needs to be built."
"Indeed, the warlords have been given too big a say in distributing aid already, and it may be hard to strip them of this power. But stripped they must be."
"The second problem involves relocating Afghan refugees now living in Pakistan and Iran, as well as those displaced within Afghanistan."
"To achieve this goal, the agricultural economy must be revived in order to revive this industry, providing jobs and food for people."
A massive impediment here is the millions of mines left over from the Soviet invasion that must be removed.
The West has a big incentive to be generous to Afghanistan's rural poor.
"Starving farmers, if unassisted, may return to cultivating a very reliable cash crop: the opium poppy, long a staple of the warlord economy."
"Eliminating it will not only help farmers and the West as it tries to curtail heroin use, but also Afghanistan's infant government as it struggles to assert its national authority against the warlords."
"A bankrupt warlord, after all, cannot buy weapons or bribe people to maintain their loyalty."
Major infrastructure investments will also be needed if the economy is to be revived.
"Housing, particularly for returning refugees, will need to be constructed fast."
"Cities such as Kabul, Mazar, Herat and others will need to be rebuilt as centers of economic and cultural life."
Village housing must be provided at a massive level.
"Roads, airports and communications systems must also be revitalized if trade is to be restored."
"The educational system needs to be rebuilt almost from scratch, and with so many women anxious to return to teaching, a revived educational system will also help Afghanistan's democratic politicians gain a powerful lobby of workers."
Particular attention should be given to elementary schools and libraries outside of cities.
"Afghanistan poses particular difficulties in reconstruction, as it is not a society with a strong political center."
Planners should take advantage of the country's decentralized nature and emphasize private sector participation in reconstruction.
A decentralized system will respond better to local needs and avoid an over-bureaucratic public sector.
But autonomous economic regions should be avoided as a threat to Afghan national unity because they would play into the hands of the warlords.
"Moreover, poorer regions would do badly in such a system."
"In the long run, Afghanistan has resources that can be exploited."
"There is the potential for oil and gas exploration, and of mining iron ore and precious metals."
These activities should be explored in a framework of economic development across Central Asia.
"Afghanistan, indeed, must be integrated into the regional pipeline and other development schemes."
Afghans can contribute in a tangible way here by reopening the North-South route connecting the resource rich economies of Central Asia to densely populated India and Pakistan.
None of this will be possible unless Afghanistan's young males are disarmed and given productive work.
"Essential here, is to attract expatriate Afghans with skills and professional achievements to help in rebuilding the country by establishing small firms that will suck up the unemployed."
"Expatriate involvement will also likely support the rights of women to participate fully and legally in economic and political life, as was the case before 1978."
"Finally, donor countries must apply the lessons learned in restoring the war-ravaged states of the former Yugoslavia."
"Grants and planning must be coordinated, and the consent of Afghanistan's neighboring countries assured."
"If the latter are ignored, regional interests can incite chaos once again."
An international conference on Afghanistan should be called by the US and held under UN auspices.
"It must affirm not only Afghanistan's territorial integrity, but insure that donor commitments meet the scale of the job and that these promises are kept."
"A decade ago, the West turned its back on Afghanistan and chaos ensued."
To abandon the country again would be criminal folly.
After the War on Terror
NEW YORK – The basic outlines of Barack Obama’s approach to foreign policy became clear in 2009.
His administration believes that the United States should talk with other governments even if it disagrees profoundly with their character.
He prefers acting with other countries to going it alone.
And he has shifted the focus of US foreign policy from what countries do within their borders to how they act beyond them.
"All of this differentiates Obama from his immediate predecessor, George W. Bush, whose administration branded selected countries as evil and mostly refused to deal with them; often rejected cooperation with other governments, lest the US find itself constrained; and sought to transform other countries, rather than to influence their actions."
"Any parallels between Obama’s foreign policy and that of Bush are more with the father, America’s 41st president, George H.W. Bush."
"Diplomacy, of course, should not be viewed as a favor or concession that signals “softness.”"
"Obama rightly recognizes that it is an important tool of foreign policy, to be employed when it promises results that are more favorable than the alternatives."
Obama is also correct that acting in concert with others is almost always desirable.
"The challenges that most define this era – nuclear proliferation, terrorism, global climate change, and pandemic disease – can be managed only collectively."
"Moreover, the reality is that the US is now too stretched economically and militarily to succeed by relying solely on its own resources."
"Finally, Obama is right to focus more on the behavior of countries than on their nature."
It is not just that the assistance of odious governments is sometimes essential; it is also that there is nothing more difficult than remaking the internal workings of other societies.
"Yet, even with these adjustments, and despite Obama’s communication skills and his personal popularity (reflected in his Nobel Peace Prize and in declining anti-Americanism around the world), 2009 was a difficult first year for his administration’s foreign policy."
"To begin with, a willingness to talk to governments does not always translate into an ability to work with them."
"The US has shown new flexibility with Iran and North Korea, but neither has reciprocated so far."
Reasonableness does not always yield results.
"Similarly, countries often choose not to cooperate."
"China, for example, resists using its influence with North Korea, fearing that instability on the Korean peninsula could lead to large refugee flows into China or a united Korea allied with the US."
China prefers an imperfect status quo to such alternatives.
"For its part, Russia appears reluctant to pressure Iran to reining in its nuclear ambitions."
"Obama has worked hard to improve US-Russian ties: bilateral arms control is again a priority, and the president agreed to alter plans for anti-missile deployments in Poland and the Czech Republic."
"But Russian leaders resist tough sanctions on Iran, lest they jeopardize financial dealings there and lead to increased Iranian support for Muslim minorities inside Russia."
"As a result, it will be difficult in 2010 and beyond to develop an effective package of sanctions and incentives that enjoys broad international backing."
"Similarly, when it came to negotiating a new pact to mitigate global climate change, diplomatic efforts had to contend with international discord in 2009, forcing leaders to postpone their efforts yet again."
"With developing countries fearing the impact of binding limits on carbon emissions on their economic growth, and with insufficient support in the US Congress, a global treaty appears unlikely in 2010 as well."
"In the Middle East, despite Obama’s vow to re-start the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, progress remained stymied by differences over the scope and content of an agreement and how to bring it about."
"The lack of forward movement stems not just from disagreement over goals, but also from the inability of a divided Palestinian leadership to compromise."
Weak protagonists make poor participants in peace negotiations.
"Moreover, other countries’ domestic politics do matter for what Obama can accomplish."
Afghanistan’s often corrupt and incompetent government undermines counter-insurgency efforts there.
Pakistan’s government does not share the same threat assessments or priorities as its American benefactor.
No amount of increased American military effort is likely to offset the resulting lack of progress in weakening extremists in both countries.
Domestic politics in the US is also getting in the way of Obama’s foreign-policy goals.
"The absence of consensus on climate change, or resistance in Congress to new trade agreements, weakens the president’s hand."
And America’s unwillingness to take meaningful steps to reduce its ballooning fiscal deficit further undermines the effectiveness of its foreign policy.
"Finally, some of what the Obama administration chose to do (singling out Israeli settlements, for example) and how it did it (Guantánamo comes to mind) made tough situations tougher."
"But the larger truth is that the world has become a more difficult place to manage, much less to lead."
"The post-Cold War era of US unipolarity has ended, owing to America’s economic mismanagement, the war in Iraq, the continuing rise of other countries, and globalization."
"There are bright spots, of course."
"America’s relations with other major powers – China, India, Japan, Russia, Europe, and Brazil – are at least as cooperative as they are competitive; conflict between such major powers, the dominant characteristic of the international order in the twentieth century, is unlikely."
"It is also possible that some of today’s most closed countries, including Iran, North Korea, Burma, Cuba, and Venezuela, will become more open and less threatening with time."
"On balance, though, early evidence suggests that this will not be an era of smooth multilateralism or American leadership."
"Something more complicated, and unwieldy, appears increasingly likely."
"Barack Obama’s next three years in office (or seven, if he is re-elected in 2012) will likely be characterized as much by frustration as by accomplishment."
A Future for the World\u0027s Coral Reefs?
"Coral reefs are the world's most biologically rich marine ecosystems, harboring some of the world's most beautiful organisms."
They provide the principal source of protein for over ten million people worldwide.
Reef-based activities (principally fishing and tourism) form the economic livelihood of millions more.
"Clearly, the human costs of a worldwide breakdown of these ecosystems are enormous."
Yet global deterioration of coral reefs is severe and ongoing.
"Wholesale disintegration of reef ecosystems has occurred in some places, and collapse on a worldwide scale is a real risk."
"But there is some good news, too: we know what steps the international community can take now to protect and restore reefs' ``resilience''-- their capacity to maintain integrity in the face of the environmental fluctuations that are a natural part of life in any ecosystem."
"We must mediate the severity of global warming, while simultaneously conserving the resilience of coral reefs."
"Historically, the principal agents of reef degradation have been over-fishing and pollution, not global warming."
"In healthy ecosystems, when prey numbers decline, predators become malnourished, and their numbers decline, too, giving their prey a chance to recover."
But human predators are different.
"When our prey numbers decline, their economic value tends to increase, so fishing intensifies."
"This means that once predator species become depleted, fishing pressure shifts towards plant-eating fish species, leading to precipitous declines in the numbers of herbivores on coral reefs."
Herbivorous fish are key players on coral reefs.
"When coral populations decline in the aftermath of cyclones, diseases, and other disturbances, it is the herbivores that keep seaweed in check, and allow coral populations to recover."
"Without them, fast-growing seaweed quickly monopolizes space on the reef, preventing restoration of healthy quantities of coral cover."
"Because corals provide the habitat structure on which other reef organisms depend, the decreases in coral cover lead to big decreases in a reef's biodiversity."
"Pollution by nutrients and toxins from adjacent land areas further vitiate coral populations' ability to recover, giving seaweed an even greater competitive edge."
Corals are formed by a symbiosis between an animal and a one-celled plant.
"The animal provides shelter and nutrients for the plant; the plant converts sunlight into energy, which it shares with the animal."
"For reasons that are not yet fully understood, this partnership breaks down when corals experience unusually high temperatures."
"The plant is expelled, and corals turn a brilliant white color."
"If temperatures soon return to normal, the partnership can be restored."
"But if corals remain ``bleached'' for too long, they die."
"For many species of coral, this bleaching threshold is usually only a couple of degrees centigrade above the typical maximum temperature for a given location."
"Interpreted in light of even the most optimistic global warming scenarios, this is disturbing news."
"If coral bleaching thresholds remain steady, local summer temperatures will exceed those thresholds regularly within a few decades."
"Corals grow slowly, so reefs sustaining severe bleaching will not recover before they bleach again."
"Fortunately, there is evidence that bleaching thresholds evolve."
"Most coral species have broad geographical distributions, and bleach at different temperatures depending on location."
Many species that bleach at 28
Two things can be done to protect coral reefs.
"The first is obvious: minimize global warming by, say, honoring the Kyoto Treaty's emissions targets."
"Second, we must restore coral reefs' capacity to cope with environmental change--their resilience--by protecting the fish stocks that keep seaweed in check, and thereby facilitate the recovery of coral populations from bleaching."
These recovery phases enable adaptations to higher temperatures to spread.
"Without fish, seaweed dominance will prevent that recovery."
The catastrophic collapse of fish stocks around the world--on coral reefs and elsewhere--has provided hard lessons about managing fisheries.
Many intensively regulated fisheries have collapsed along with the unregulated ones.
So there is a growing consensus that standard techniques for managing fisheries must be complemented with a system of ``no-take zones''--areas in which fishing is prohibited altogether.
"As fish populations in these no-take zones recover, they create ``spill-over'' effects, with catches often increasing in areas outside the no-take zones."
"More importantly, they provide a refuge for fish populations, a kind of insurance policy against stock collapse."
"On coral reefs, these no-take zones can help insure that a portion of coral reef habitat sustains a healthy fish community, and secure the coral reef resilience that this brings."
"Scientific evidence indicates that, to be effective, 30-50% of available habitat should be set aside as no-take zones."
"This figure is far higher than levels of protection in even the wealthiest countries that harbor significant coral reefs, the US and Australia, where current levels of protection are less than 5%."
"Given the magnitude of the threat to the world's coral reefs, the international community's response has been frighteningly slow."
"But there is some encouraging news: in June, Australia's government proposed a major increase in no-take areas within the Great Barrier Reef to over 30%."
"If adopted, this policy would set a new global standard and perhaps prompt other nations to follow suit."
"The future of tropical marine ecosystems, and the millions of people whose lives are linked to them, depend on it."
Against Simplification
NEW YORK – It is said that Americans have a genius for simplification.
"Gradually, however, the quest for it has become a global trend, one that continues to conquer new territories, just as blue jeans once did."
The speed of our daily life is visibly increased – and not for the better – by this unstoppable evolution.
The tyranny of pragmatism seems to mark all of the complex dilemmas of our time.
Too many valid choices are ignored or skirted through the routine of short-cuts.
Nowhere is this trend more damaging than in today’s mercantile approach to art.
"Even the much-praised notion of competition seems fake and cynically manipulated by the “corporate” mentality that now pervades the world of culture – by the financial pre-selection that determines what publishers, producers, and other impresarios will support."
"Just imagine what might have happened with the works of, say, Proust, Kafka, Musil, Faulkner, or Borges had they been subjected to mass-market competition like shoes or cosmetics."
"Culture is a necessary pause from the daily rat race, from our chaotic and often vulgar political surroundings, and it is a chance to recover our spiritual energy."
"Great books, music, and paintings are not only an extraordinary school of beauty, truth, and good, but also a way of discovering our own beauty, truth, and good – the potential for change, of bettering ourselves and even some of our interlocutors."
"If this respite and refuge is gradually narrowed and invaded by the same kind of “products” as those that dominate the mass market, we are condemned to be perpetual captives of the same stunted universe of “practicalities,” the ordinary agglomeration of clichés packaged in advertisements."
"I was thinking again about these old and seemingly unsolvable questions during my re-reading of a quite challenging novel by a close friend and a great writer, not very present in the vivid landscape of American letters of today."
"The theme, style, and echo of his work says a lot, I think, about our simplified world."
"The novel is Blinding, by Claudio Magris."
"Hailed in Europe as one of the great novels of the twentieth century, Blinding arrived in America only after a great delay, and never received the attention that it deserved."
"Unfortunately, that is no surprise."
"The number of literary translations done nowadays in the United States is, according to a United Nations report, equal to that of Greece, a country one-tenth the size. Imported books are thought to be too “complicated,” which is another way of saying that literature should deal with simple issues in a simple way, obeying the rules of the mass market, with its tricks of packaging, accessibility, advertisement, and comfort."
"At the core of Magris’ book is the destiny of a group of Italian communists who travel to Yugoslavia after the Second World War to contribute to the construction of a socialist society, only to be caught in the conflict between Stalin and Tito."
"They are imprisoned for their Stalinist allegiance; when they are finally allowed to return to Italy, their old comrades refuse to accept them."
The book’s plot spans two centuries of revolution.
"Then, suddenly,"
"“the party vanished, overnight, as if all of a sudden a giant sponge had drained the entire sea, Adriatic and Austral, leaving litter and clots of mud, and all the boats stranded."
"How can you go home again if the sea has been sucked down a vast drain that opened up beneath it, emptying it who knows where, into a void?"
"The earth is arid and dead, but there won’t be another one, nor another heaven.”"
"The solitude of the individual facing his faith alone, without collective illusions, and forced to do something with himself in the arid, noisy world tells us something important about the exiled world of modernity and its complex and contradictory problems."
"Magris’s novel is not only an important literary achievement; it also has a deep connection to the dangers that we face now, particularly the wave of fanaticism, from Mumbai to Oslo, in the name of a holy war against the “other.”"
"Are all the extremists searching for a new coherence, for a lost illusion of togetherness and a new hope of resurrection?"
"Can we ever forget September 11, 2001, the start of a bloody century in which the mystical force of hatred and destruction has recovered its strength?"
"Are Osama Bin Laden’s minions, the bloody Hamas-Hezbollah battalions, or troubled loners like Timothy McVeigh, Theodore Kaczynski, and now Norway’s Anders Behring Breivik, the “heroes” of our contemporary nightmare?"
"Is this the “rebel” response to an overly globalized, incoherent, and ultimately disturbing reality?"
"If so, their barbarism demands scrutiny – in relation to both historical precedent and to our modernity – rather than merely being labeled “monstrous” (though it certainly is that)."
"The new religious militants, fighting in the name of their particular and peculiar God, seem as fanaticized as the Fascists, Nazis, and Communists of earlier decades."
"Magris’s main character is a rebel in more than one embodiment: as Salvatore Cipico, one of the inmates in the communist concentration camp in Yugoslavia; as Jurgen Jurgensen, ephemeral king of Iceland and a convict forced to build his own jail; and as Jason, the mythic adventurer searching for the volatile truth."
"A multilayered and complex chronicle of the devastating tragedies of the twentieth century, Blinding is an insistent, informed, and irreplaceable incursion into the moving landscape of the human soul, its wounds and voids, its vitality and versatility, its deep distortions and its unpredictable dynamics."
"It is a fascinating story about the conflict between ideals and reality, or Utopia and humanness; about being faithful to a cause and betraying it; and about sacrifice and solidarity."
It is also a rich and original literary achievement that challenges today’s consumerist ethic.
"By renouncing simplicity, it also repudiates today’s prevailing confusion of information with literature, of facts with creativity, and best-selling products with true works of art."
A Gasp from Europe
French President Jacques Chirac has alarmed the EU candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
"The French president has accused them of being ""childish"" and ""irresponsible"" in voicing their pro-US stance on the Iraq issue, and warned that their position could be ""dangerous,"" as the decision to let them into the EU has not yet been ratified."
Quite a salvo.
"Then the French president assumed the role of kindergarten instructor vis-à-vis what he called ""badly brought up"" candidate countries, telling them that they were ""ill-behaved"" and that ""they missed a great opportunity to shut up."""
To anyone who remembers that 40 years ago President Charles de Gaulle slammed Europe's door shut in the face of Britain's request to join the European community--the General thought the British too tied to the US to enter the European family--these remarks are worrying.
But put things in perspective: Jacques Chirac is not Charles de Gaulle; and Europe has moved far beyond the time when its agenda was unilaterally written by France.
"President Chirac's self-appointed role as an expert in diplomatic good behavior cannot be taken seriously, even by those of us who know (and love) France."
"Instead, his outburst is best explained as a sign of frustration over the fact that French influence in the EU is being diluted."
"Like King Lear after he lost his kingdom, there is nothing France can do about its lost influence but rage impotently."
But this dispute within Europe goes deeper than the matter of France's lapsed primacy.
"I have always been skeptical about the rhetoric of a ""common"" foreign policy for the EU."
"How can you possibly expect a country such as, say, France to accept being voted down by its EU partners on vital foreign and security policy issues?"
"At best, Europe should hope for a ""more common"" foreign and security policy, even though this fails to answer Henry Kissinger's old question: If you want to speak to ""Europe,"" whom do you call?"
"I have long worked to secure a ""much more common"" foreign policy within the EU."
Therefore I am worried by today's split within the EU as well as between some member countries and the US over Iraq.
"When eight European leaders published their appeal to heal the growing transatlantic rift, they were accused of undermining European unity."
Nothing could be more incorrect.
They were only exposing the lack of unity that already existed.
"It all began last autumn when German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, desperate to hold on to power, made Iraq an issue in the German election campaign."
He played on Germany's well-known and respectable pacifist feelings.
"But by declaring that he would not, under any circumstance, participate in military actions against Iraq, he undermined the efforts at the UN to put maximum pressure behind the demands that Iraq disarm."
Then France embraced Germany.
"French ways in foreign policy are often murky and difficult to decipher, unless it is crystal clear where France regards its interests to lie."
Usually France likes to keep its options open.
"But when the French and German governments celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the Elysée Treaty last month, France seemed to paint herself into a corner by supporting the German view."
All this was done without consultations between the French and German governments and their partners within the EU.
It was a demonstration of the special relationship between France and Germany that has for so many years been the driving force in European integration.
The history of Franco-German reconciliation is impressive indeed.
But it can no longer be taken for granted that other EU countries will automatically ratify the agreements that they reach between themselves as the lodestar for common policies.
"This is particularly true when their objective is to establish an ""alternative"" to American leadership in security policy."
Enlargement of the EU with a number of Central and Eastern European countries will strengthen resistance to Franco-German initiatives in this direction.
"The letter from the eight European leaders--and the later statement from the ""Vilnius Ten"" group of Central and Eastern European countries--demonstrated that France (and Germany) cannot dictate a European agenda that creates transatlantic rifts."
This has obviously caused frustrations. But it should not have been a surprise to anyone.
The split within the EU and NATO has increased the risk of armed conflict with Iraq because the pressure on Iraq to comply with the UN resolutions was weakened.
Chirac and Schröder do not seem to grasp this.
"So this has not been one of Europe's finest hours, especially not while the EU's institutional convention is discussing a text that calls for EU governments to ""actively and unreservedly support the Union's common foreign policy."""
"The German acronym for the EU's ""common foreign and security policy"" is GASP."
That seems an entirely appropriate expression for what we have been witnessing.
A Gazan Education
GAZA – This was supposed to be my first year of medical school.
"Instead, I am stuck here in Gaza, in my father’s house inside the Jabalia refugee camp, with few options and no way out."
"After I finished high school last year, I decided to become a doctor."
"Gaza cries out for bone specialists, but the training I need is available only abroad."
"When I won a place at a medical college in Germany, my parents were proud. I was excited to follow my older brother, who is already studying there."
"In February, the German authorities granted me an entrance visa."
I wasted no time in asking the Israeli authorities for permission to travel to Europe. But I was told that only patients in need of emergency medical evacuation would be allowed out – not students.
Hundreds of other young people trapped in the Gaza Strip have won admission to study abroad.
"For many of us, this is our only opportunity to continue our education."
"Gaza is one of the most densely populated places on earth, and one of the poorest – 1.5 million of us live on a patch of land about 41 kilometers long and 6-12 kilometers wide."
"The local hospitals lack the equipment needed to perform many important procedures, like radiation treatments for cancer patients and heart surgery."
Universities in Gaza are overcrowded and starved for supplies.
"Many subjects are not even taught, and there are few post-graduate programs."
Instructors from abroad cannot enter Gaza.
"Without the ability to go overseas, we cannot learn."
"In June, after the United States pressured Israel to allow Fulbright scholarship winners to leave the Gaza Strip, the Israeli military announced that it would grant exit permits for a few more students with “recognized” scholarships – but not “hundreds.”"
"So hundreds of us are still waiting, most without prestigious scholarships to draw the world’s attention."
I am sure to be one of the many who will not be allowed to leave.
Life in Gaza has bled away my optimism.
My father is a teacher and owns a children’s clothing shop. My mother is a housekeeper.
I have six brothers and three sisters.
"We returned to Palestine in 1996 from Saudi Arabia, where my father had been working as a teacher."
That was at the height of the peace process.
"My parents put their hope in the Oslo Accords signed in 1993, and decided that they could give us a better life here."
"But when I was ten, the second"
"With the backing of the US, Canada, and the European Union, Israel has maintained its blockade in an attempt to defeat Hamas, which won the elections here in 2006. But the blockade only makes people more desperate."
"Hamas and other armed groups, I know, have launched rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip that have killed civilians in Israeli towns and villages."
"But I also have witnessed how Israel has retaliated with air strikes and armed incursions into the Gaza Strip, including Jabalia."
Israel’s blockade amounts to collective punishment.
"It is hurting all of us, whether we support Hamas or not."
It is also destroying my dream to write “Specialist in Bone Medicine” after my name.
"Sometimes, I am sorry that I am from Gaza. But my hope is still to go abroad, learn skills, and return to help others here."
"Sometimes, when there is electricity, I watch television and see how people live in other places."
"I ask myself why they have the opportunity to travel, to study, to take vacations, when I cannot go abroad even to learn medicine."
"We are students, not soldiers."
We are not fighters in this conflict.
Why doesn’t Israel let us go study?
Why do Europe and America support a blockade of young minds?
"Soon, my fellow classmates at the medical college will be starting classes."
"When they do, I will probably still be here in my father’s house, waiting for the blockade to end."
A Gender Divided
"OXFORD – The top and the bottom of the list of countries in Newsweek’s recent cover story, “The 2011 Global Women’s Progress Report,” evoke images of two different worlds."
"At the top of the list – the “Best Places to be a Woman” – we see the usual suspects: Iceland and the Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Canada."
"On that planet, we see rankings in the upper 90’s for the survey’s five categories: justice, health, education, economics, and politics."
"Women are out-earning men in college degrees (United States), domestic abusers are being banned from their homes and tracked with electronic monitors (Turkey), and female prime ministers are being elected (Denmark and Australia)."
"Now look at the other planet, “The Worst Places in the World to be a Woman.”"
"In Chad, the worst of the worst, woman have “almost no legal rights,” and girls as young as ten are legally married off, which is also true in Niger, the seventh worst place for a woman."
Most women in Mali – the fifth worst – have been traumatized by female genital mutilation.
"In Democratic Republic of Congo, 1,100 women are raped every day. In Yemen, you are free to beat your wife whenever you like."
"Though it is stunning to see these two worlds in such stark and detailed relief, their existence is not news: development specialists and human rights groups have been calling attention to these inequities for years. But the systemic oppression of women tends to be cast in terms of claims for empathy: we shouldn’t follow these policies because they are not nice, not enlightened."
"Some development researchers have started to make a compelling case, too, that oppression of women impedes countries’ efforts to escape poverty."
"But the data in the Newsweek list show that we need to frame this issue in stronger, more sweeping terms: When poor countries choose to oppress their own women, they are to some extent choosing their own continued poverty."
"Female oppression is a moral issue; but it also must be seen as a choice that countries make for short-term “cultural” comfort, at the expense of long-term economic and social progress."
It is not politically correct to attribute any share of very poor countries’ suffering to their own decisions. But it is condescending to refuse to hold many of them partly responsible for their own plight.
"Obviously, the legacy of colonialism – widespread hunger, illiteracy, lack of property or legal recourse, and vulnerability to state violence – is a major factor in their current poverty. But how can we blame that legacy while turning a blind eye to a kind of colonialism against women in these same countries’ private homes and public institutions?"
"When the poorest countries – most of them in Africa or with Muslim majorities – choose to sustain and even devise new policies that oppress women, we have to be willing to say that, in some measure, they are choosing the economic misfortune that follows."
"The developed world’s silence suggests that it takes the mistreatment of black and brown women by black and brown men for granted, rather than holding all people to one standard of justice."
The “surprises” on the Newsweek list confirm that educating women boosts economic prosperity.
"Many countries with histories of colonialism and other forms of tyranny, as well as countries without abundant natural resources, have chosen to educate women and grant them legal rights."
"Some continue to struggle economically, but none is abjectly poor – and some are booming."
"Think of China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, South Korea, and Turkey."
"The low status of women on Planet Worst cannot be blamed on cultural stasis: many of the “surprise” countries – Romania, Portugal, the Philippines, and India – treated women far more unequally a mere 50-100 years ago."
"In Pakistan, marital rape is not illegal today, and there are 800 honor killings a year."
What kind of economic boom might stagnating Pakistan enjoy if patriarchy relaxed its grip?
"If you are not innumerate, you can start a business."
"If you are not living in mortal fear of rape and beatings at home, you can organize your community to dig a new well."
"If you are not subjecting your daughter to traumatic genital injury at three and marrying her off at ten, she can go to school. And, when she does marry and has children of her own, they will benefit from two educated, employed parents, which means twice as much literate conversation in the home, twice the contacts, and twice the encouragement to succeed."
"Educated, pushy mothers make all the difference."
"As US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put it in the Newsweek issue, “The world needs to think more strategically and creatively about tapping into women’s potential for growth."
Studies show that helping women access trade and grow businesses helps create jobs and boost incomes.”
"But on Planet Worst, forcing terrified, uneducated women to remain at home is more socially acceptable than facing the fact that this means choosing to drag down incomes for everyone."
It is time to stop tiptoeing around the poorest countries’ responsibility to do something essential about their own plight: emancipate their women.
A German Conservative Credo
Few concepts are as elastic as that of ``Conservatism.''
"At one end of its spectrum of meanings, conservatism has (over the last two decades) come to be viewed as promoting too much of a civic life of greed and grab."
"At the other end, conservatism in many European countries has historically veered too close for comfort to right-wing extremism."
"In Germany today, conservatism was forged in the wake of the Weimar Republic's failures, experiences unknown to Anglo-Saxon conservatives."
"This history accounts for the type of conservatism practiced by the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian-Social Union (CSU), who focus on moderation and balance, preservation and innovation, and on commanding Germany's political center."
"With federal elections due in Germany this autumn, much will be said about the nature of German conservatism."
"Some, looking at CDU/CSU candidate for Chancellor Edmund Stoiber's emphasis on Bavaria's economic success, will seek to portray the coalition as shaded dangerously by the ``anything goes'' market conservatism practiced in America."
"Others, pointing to the German conservatives' emphasis on social values, will say that we are as statist as the Social Democrats."
"The truth itself is far more complex than these facile comparisons, which also makes it more durable."
"CDU/CSU policies are, of course, founded on the idea of individual freedom, but we believe in an individualism tempered by Western culture and the Christian tradition."
"We are skeptical about unfettered individualism because of our awareness of man's sins, but also because of our profound awareness of the historical defects and aberrations in Germany's 20 th century history."
"Yet, despite this deeply ingrained skepticism about human nature, we embrace humanity's talent for progress and innovation, because we recognize man's ability to correct mistakes and errors."
"These two traits, although they seem to conflict, and are certainly different from the values of American and British conservatives, nonetheless form a sound basis for a realistic pragmatism and the shunning of ideological politics - which is precisely the politics that Germany now requires."
"Far from being willing to coerce people to live in a certain way, German conservatives seek a politics that recognizes limits - the limits of the state, the market, and the individual."
"We conceive of politics as a mechanism to reconcile enduring conflicts, such as those that exist between freedom and security."
"Each, indeed, is unsustainable without the other."
"Security is useless without freedom, but freedom makes no sense without security - both national security and economic security."
"The social market economy, which we continue to embrace, is based on these principles."
"It sees competition as the most effective means to promote economic growth, but also embraces state interference, when necessary, to secure equality of opportunity, social solidarity, and social balance."
This interference is also intended to help avoid the ``economization'' of all aspects of civic life.
"The market is merely a tool, not an answer to every human problem."
"It is in recognition of this fact that German conservatives strive, for example, to strike a balance between economy and ecology."
"We feel responsible, on a global level, for the environment, which is why we disagree with unilateral decisions by individual nations when such decisions ignore the needs of the rest of the world."
For globalization is both a challenge and an opportunity.
"As we open ourselves to the wind's of globalization, we must also strengthen the local institutions that foster social ties and identity, such as the family, local and regional communities, religious communities, and the tradition of voluntary worker solidarity - all which have been neglected in recent years."
"This is the principle of ``subsidiarity'' which supports placing decision-making power, wherever and whenever possible, in governmental bodies nearest to the individual citizen."
"This is of particular importance for our ideas about the European Union, where we seek an effective balance between the nation and Europe."
"For German conservatives, European integration and national identity are not warring concepts, as they seem to be to our opponents and so many others. They are, instead, two sides of the same coin."
The EU was founded in recognition that certain goals could only be achieved through cooperation.
"Decades later, the European Union still needs the binding power and legitimacy of its constituent nations, as well as of historical regional political structures within those nations, because a common European identity is emerging only slowly and cannot yet justify a unitary constitutional structure."
"In essence, the form of government we seek within Germany and across Europe is built on a sense of moral discourse and moral decision-making rather than on the supposedly eternal truth of some abstract political concept."
"Indeed, only an ongoing skepticism of fashionable political nostrums - both of the statist and market fundamentalist variety - can promote pluralism and tolerance, and avoid a ballooning of the bureaucracy that enfeebles our economy."
"In a fast changing world, this skepticism of the center is the only sensible attitude a responsible political party and government can strike."
"Our political approach embraces this humane and realistic pragmatism, for it is only such an approach that offers a chance to secure a prosperous stability within which necessary change can be made without ending up in an extremist euphoria or a fear of the future."
"Moderation, tolerance, and a capacity for reform in equal measure are the watchwords of today's German conservatism."
A German Glimmer in a Global Boom
"In 2004, the world economy grew at a rate of 5.1%, the fastest pace in the last 28 years."
"While Ifo`s World Economic Climate indicator, generated from quarterly surveys of 1,200 experts in 90 countries, worsened slightly during the first three quarters of 2005, it rose again in the last quarter, indicating a continuation of the boom."
"In 2005, growth is estimated to have been about 4.3%, and a similar rate can be expected in 2006, marking a period of sustained rapid global growth unseen since the 1970’s."
But the boom is not uniform.
"In the United States, the number of experts giving a favorable assessment of the current situation declined; indeed, a majority believes that the economic situation will worsen during the next six months."
"However, in the Asian countries, including China, the optimism is unbroken."
"The same is true for Eastern Europe, the ex-Soviet states, and Latin America."
"The big surprise is Europe, which, unlike in 2004 and the first half of 2005, now seems to be catching up with the rest of the world."
"Whereas growth was a miserable 1.5% in 2005 in the 15 “old” members of the European Union, Ifo expects EU-15 growth to accelerate to 2.1% in 2006."
"To be sure, economic performance will vary widely among EU countries."
"While Italy will be the laggard, with only 1.1% growth, the Irish rocket will not lose its force, pushing real GDP up by about 4.8%."
"In general, the big EU countries are still performing badly, in contrast to the smaller members – hardly surprising, given that the EU is basically an institution to help the smaller countries overcome the drawback of their size by extending the agglomeration advantages that formerly were reserved to the bigger countries."
"But even Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, is experiencing an upswing."
"The Ifo climate indicator for Germany, based on monthly surveys of 7,000 firms, jumped upwards in the second half of 2005, reaching its highest value since the boom year 2000, with businesses’ assessment of the current situation and expectations improving."
"After five years of stagnation, the economy is finally on the move."
"The driving force is external demand, as Germany, the world’s second-largest exporter, profits from the global boom."
Exports increased by 6.2% in 2005 and are expected to increase by 7.4% in 2006.
"However, as we saw in 2004 and 2005, exports are not enough to create substantial growth if domestic demand does not follow."
"The good news for Germany is that investment demand is now growing, too."
"While the second half of 2005 was already quite good, Ifo expects investment in equipment to grow by a healthy 6% in 2006."
"After many years of contraction, investment in construction also will rise slightly."
"Total investment growth is expected to reach 2.9% – weak by past standards, but nonetheless a promising salve for the wounded German mood."
"Moreover, any investment growth is vital for Germany, which, according to the latest OECD statistics, currently suffers from the world’s lowest share of net investment in national income."
"Even if Germany remains the world’s laggard, rising investment demand as such will contribute to GDP growth, which Ifo estimates at 1.7% in 2006."
That number looks small compared to most other countries.
"In fact, all EU countries except Italy and the Netherlands will grow faster."
"But everything is relative: Germany’s trend growth rate is just 1.1%, and the country has been the slowest growing EU country since 1995."
"Measured against a disappointing past, even Germany is currently experiencing an economic boom."
"Indeed, even German unemployment, which has been rising in cycles since 1970, will decline slightly in 2006, from 4.8 to 4.7 million."
"The good economic data will reinforce initial favorable impressions of Angela Merkel’s new government, which got off to an excellent start at the EU Summit, where Merkel helped to broker a compromise between Britain and France on the Union’s 2007-2013 budget (by adding another €2 billion to Germany’s annual contribution)."
"In fact, the government may even have contributed a bit to the good economic data by announcing a serious effort to consolidate Germany’s own public finances – a prerequisite for investor confidence."
"According to the government, substantial tax increases will bring the fiscal deficit below the 3%-of-GDP limit set by the Stability and Growth Pact – a target missed for five consecutive years – by 2007."
The real test for the German government is the labor market.
Most observers now agree that Germany needs something like the American earned-income tax credit.
"In Germany, it’s called “activating social aid” or “combi wages,” but the principle is the same: the state should reduce the money it pays for doing nothing and pay more for participating in the work force."
"That would widen the wage distribution, create jobs, and maintain the living standard of the poor."
Merkel announced in her inaugural speech in the Bundestag that her government will introduce such a system in 2006.
"If this is more than lip service, and if she really carries out a serious reform of the German welfare state’s incentive structure, the result could be higher employment and structural economic growth."
"In the long term, that would be more promising for the EU – and for the global economy – than the demand-driven performance that Germany is currently enjoying."
A Global Agenda for Seven Billion
"NEW YORK – Late next month, a child will be born – the 7th billion citizen of planet Earth. We will never know the circumstances into which he or she was born."
"We do know that the baby will enter a world of vast and unpredictable change – environmental, economic, geopolitical, technological, and demographic."
The world’s population has tripled since the United Nations was created in 1945.
"And our numbers keep growing, with corresponding pressures on land, energy, food, and water. The global economy is generating pressures as well: rising joblessness, widening social inequalities, and the emergence of new economic powers."
These trends link the fate and future of today’s seven billion people as never before. No nation alone can solve the great global challenges of the twenty-first century. International cooperation is a universal need.
"The 66th session of the UN General Assembly is a renewed opportunity for the countries of the world to set aside narrow, short-term interests and commit to cooperative efforts to address humanity’s long-term imperatives."
"At a time when all nations are experiencing individual challenges, we need to forge a worldwide common agenda that can help to ensure that the seven billionth baby and future generations grow up in a world characterized by sustainable peace, prosperity, freedom, and justice."
"To help create this future, I am focusing my second term as Secretary-General on five global imperatives – five generational opportunities to shape the world of tomorrow by the decisions we make today."
"The first and greatest of these imperatives is sustainable development. We all must understand that saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, and advancing economic growth are one and the same fight. We must connect the dots between climate change, water scarcity, energy shortages, global health, food security, and women’s empowerment. Solutions to one problem must be solutions for all."
"In the next five years, we need to create a new economic vision for sustainable development and forge global consensus on a binding climate change agreement."
"Fostering economic growth, realizing the Millennium Development Goals, and combating climate change will all depend on creating a new energy system for the twenty-first century and extending it to every person on the planet."
Prevention as a framework for international cooperation is a second opportunity.
"This year, the UN peacekeeping budget will total $8 billion. Think of what we could save by avoiding conflicts – by deploying political mediation missions, for example, rather than troops."
We know how to do this.
"Our record proves it – in Guinea, Kenya, and Kyrgyzstan."
"A third imperative is building a safer and more secure world. In this effort, we must be courageous in standing up for democracy, human rights, and peace."
"This year was one of signature achievements in restoring and securing peace – in Côte d’Ivoire, Darfur, Egypt, and elsewhere. But hatred and bloodshed still stand in the way of our vision for peace."
"In the Middle East, we must break the stalemate."
Palestinians deserve a state.
Israel needs security.
"Both want peace. A negotiated settlement can produce these outcomes, and the UN is a platform for forging such a peace."
"So, too, will we continue our efforts to foster democratic governance in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Sierra Leone. And, in the name of all of humanity, we will continue to push forward on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, in service of realizing a world free of nuclear weapons."
The fourth big opportunity is supporting countries in transition.
This year’s dramatic events in North Africa and the Middle East inspired people around the globe.
Let us help make the Arab Spring a true season of hope for all.
"In Libya, we are deploying a new UN support mission to assist the country’s transitional authorities in establishing a new government and legal order, consistent with the aspirations of the Libyan people."
Syria is a special concern.
For six months we have seen escalating violence and repression.
The government has repeatedly pledged to undertake reforms and listen to its people.
It has not done so.
The moment to act is now.
The violence must stop.
Last but not least is the imperative of working with and for women and young people.
Women hold up more than half the sky and represent much of the world’s unrealized potential.
"We need their full engagement – in government, business, and civil society."
"The UN has placed a high priority on promoting women at all levels of the Organization and this year, for the first time, UN Women is operating to promote the interests and rights of women all over the world."
Seven billion people now look toward the United Nations for solutions to the world’s great global challenges.
They hold different religions and backgrounds but common dreams and aspirations.
Our global future depends on bringing these individual talents and universal rights together in common cause.
Let our common agenda begin.
A Global Civics Lesson
ISTANBUL – The reality of the world’s epic interdependence is well known.
"We have seen how financial engineering in the United States can determine economic growth in every part of the world; how carbon-dioxide emissions from China end up influencing crop yields and livelihoods in Vietnam, Bangladesh, the Maldives, and beyond; how an epidemic in Mexico endangers the rhythm of public life in the US; or how volcanic ash from Iceland affects travel across Europe."
"We are also familiar with the inherent difficulties of devising and implementing solutions to global problems through nation-states, and have relied on two broad models to deal with this predicament."
The first is composed of a wide range of creative ad hoc alliances and solutions.
"When standard global public health instruments proved insufficient, for example, we built the Global Fund to Fight Tuberculosis, AIDS, and Malaria."
"When the Internet became global, its management was turned over to ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which enlists the voices of individual Internet users in its governance – a significant departure from intergovernmental multilateralism."
"The US, as the most powerful member of the international system, tends to prefer ad hoc approaches to global governance."
"With its vast resources and alliances, ad hoc solutions allow the US to advance its interests effectively without the entanglements of more enduring rules, customs, and structures."
"Europeans prefer a more systematic reliance on the rule of law, and also on what has come to be known as the global public-goods paradigm."
"Adherents of this view point first and foremost to the existence of certain vital global public goods, climate being the most obvious example."
"By definition, public goods mean a collective-action problem."
"The global public-goods paradigm also implies some commensurability, if not uniformity, in the way we respond to various global collective-action challenges."
"Americans tend to find this expectation of commensurability suffocating, while Europeans find it reassuring and liberating."
"(The developing world has been largely absent in this debate, with notable exceptions in the form of indignation about unfairness built into the status quo, peppered with obstructionism.)"
"Like many other cardinal questions, the tension between these approaches is unlikely to be resolved conclusively."
"We are more likely to live with this tension for a long time, with emphasis shifting back and forth between approaches."
It would thus be much more worthwhile to focus on a neglected issue: what responsibilities do we all have toward people who happen not to be our compatriots?
"Both the ad hoc and the global public-goods schools shy away from this question, and yet without at least some working answer, we will lack the compass needed to navigate our increasing global interdependence."
We need to recognize that global governance is not a technocratic puzzle to be solved by clever institutional design.
We cannot establish an effective social contract without an explicit understanding of our responsibilities towards each other – and of the rights that emerge alongside those responsibilities.
"The answers are to be found not only in the speeches given at the United Nations General Assembly or at the Davos World Economic Forum, but in the conversations we have with our friends, families, and colleagues."
"We must all consider what responsibilities we are willingly ready to accept, and then discuss our answers with others."
"This will mean starting to imagine – without panic or rush, and with all the care and thoughtfulness that this conversation requires – a global civics."
Current and probable future levels of global connectivity and interdependence enable and require us to commence this conversation.
"Whether or not we realize it, we have comparable conversations every day."
"For example, every day millions of people drive at high speeds encased in a ton of metal, and they do so extremely close to others who are doing the same thing."
"A slight move of the steering wheel in the wrong direction would wreak havoc, but we cruise carefree, because we have reasonable expectations about the behavior of other drivers."
"Our expectations of other drivers, which serve to mitigate the theoretical risks of driving, can exist because people adhere to a framework of laws, habits, and conventions about how to operate automobiles."
"In an increasingly interdependent world, we need a corresponding global framework to put our minds at relative ease. That framework has to be based on global civics, a system of conscious responsibilities that we are ready to take on – and corresponding rights that we are ready to claim – after due deliberation."
"To imagine the shape of global civics, a worthwhile exercise would be to take 15 minutes to consider what we would say to the seven billionth human being – who will join us in less than a thousand days – about the human condition awaiting her."
"This hypothetical conversation would help us take stock of global conditions that we have all helped produce, and would set us on a path toward discovering our core responsibilities to each other and the next generation – the essence of global civics."
A Global Consensus Against Terrorism
Mention the United Nations and the first reaction is likely to be the ongoing oil-for-food scandal and what it will mean for Secretary-General Kofi Annan’s ability to lead the organization for the remaining year and a half of his tenure.
But there is much more going on at the UN than investigations.
"Reform is in the air – in part because of the scandal, but also because of the UN’s inability to deal effectively with challenges ranging from Rwanda and Kosovo to Iraq and, most recently, Sudan."
Even the UN’s most ardent supporters now recognize that change is called for if the organization is to make a significant contribution to international peace and security.
Some of the reform talk concerns the UN Security Council’s composition.
The Security Council represents what the World War II Allies believed the post-war world would look like and how it should be run.
This helps to explain why a much-weakened France was made a permanent member of the Council – and why Germany and Japan (and a not-yet independent India) were not.
Defending the Security Council’s current make-up is impossible; the need for change is beyond debate.
But coming up with an approach that gains broad international support will prove extremely difficult.
"Great Britain and France will resist being replaced by a single EU seat, while making Germany a permanent member would only exacerbate the problem of Europe’s relative over-representation."
Pakistan would object to adding India to the Security Council;
"Argentina, Chile, and Mexico to adding Brazil;"
"Nigeria to South Africa (and vice-versa); and several countries, including China, Indonesia, and South Korea, might resist creating a permanent seat for Japan."
"Clearly, fixing the Security Council will require considerable time and political effort."
"In the meantime, there is important work to be done."
"One productive avenue would be to follow up on one of the recommendations of the High Level Panel that was endorsed by Annan; namely, that all UN members go on record declaring that terrorism has no place in today’s world."
This will prove more difficult than it first sounds.
"For too long, the international community has tolerated terrorism – the intentional killing of civilians and noncombatants by non-state actors for political purposes – on the grounds that, on occasion, “one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter.”"
Historians have the luxury of debating whether terrorism may have been justified in certain situations in the past.
We do not.
"Modern terrorism is too destructive to be tolerated, much less supported."
"Weapons of mass destruction – nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons – are just that, and no cause can excuse their use."
"Moreover, as the terrorist attacks on America of 2001 showed, weapons as basic as box-cutters can become weapons of mass destruction if they are used to exploit the vulnerabilities of modern, global life."
Terrorism is even less justified given that political avenues exist nowadays for pursuing political aims.
"Palestinians can negotiate their future relationship with Israel and can count on American, Russian, European, and UN assistance."
Iraqis have elected their own representatives and are poised to write their constitution.
No one pursuing reasonable goals and who is prepared to compromise can argue that terrorism is his or his group’s only option.
The world has already taken some important steps against terrorism.
"A dozen international conventions and numerous UN resolutions commit governments to oppose hostage taking, the hijacking of civilian aircraft, and terrorism more broadly."
"Similarly, the mandate of the Financial Action Task Force, created in 1989 to curb money laundering, has grown and become focused mainly on curbing terrorist financing."
"UN Security Council Resolution 1373, passed after the September 11 attacks, calls on states to deny safe haven to terrorists, bring to justice anyone associated with terrorism, suppress recruitment by terrorist groups, block terrorists’ efforts to acquire weapons, and cooperate with other governments and international organizations in tracking suspects and boosting security."
"What is missing is a new, 13th convention that closes the loophole that seems to permit governments to decide what constitutes terrorism and what does not."
"Broad agreement is needed that any intentional killing of civilians and noncombatants is unacceptable, and that its perpetrators and supporters must be punished."
"Of course, such a convention will not prevent all future acts of terrorism. But ideas matter."
Terrorism needs to be de-legitimized in the way that slavery has been.
Doing so will make governments and individuals think twice before becoming a party to terrorism; it should also make it less difficult to garner support for international action against those who nevertheless carry it out.
We are taught early on in our lives that the end cannot justify the means.
It is time to put this principle into effect before many more innocent lives are lost.
A Global Green New Deal
"NAIROBI – With unemployment soaring, bankruptcies climbing, and stock markets in free-fall, it may at first glance seem sensible to ditch the fight against climate change and put environmental investments on hold."
"But this would be a devastating mistake of immediate, as well as inter-generational, proportions."
"Far from burdening an already over-stressed, over-stretched global economy, environmental investments are exactly what is needed to get people back to work, get order books flowing, and assist in powering economies back to health."
"In the past, concern for the environment was viewed as a luxury; today, it is a necessity – a point grasped by some, but by no means all, economic architects yet."
"A big slice of President Barack Obama’s $825 billion stimulus package for the United States includes a boost to renewable energy, “weatherizing” a million homes, and upgrading the country’s inefficient electricity grid."
"Such investments could generate an estimated five million “green-collar” jobs, provide a shot in the arm for the construction and engineering industries, and get America back into the equally serious business of combating climate change and achieving energy security."
"The Republic of Korea, which is losing jobs for the first time in more than five years, has also spotted the green lining to grim economic times."
President Lee Myung-Bak’s government plans to invest $38 billion employing people to clean up four major rivers and reduce disaster risks by building embankments and water-treatment facilities.
"Other elements of Lee’s plan include construction of eco-friendly transportation networks, such as high-speed railways and hundreds of kilometers of bicycle tracks, and generating energy using waste methane from landfills."
The package also counts on investments in hybrid vehicle technologies.
"Similar pro-employment “Green New Deal” packages have been lined up in China, Japan, and the United Kingdom."
"They are equally relevant to developing economies in terms of jobs, fighting poverty, and creating new opportunities at a time of increasingly uncertain commodity prices and exports."
"In South Africa, the government-backed"
This work is set to expand as more than 40 million tons of invasive alien plants are harvested for power-station fuel.
"As a result, an estimated 500 megawatts of electricity, equal to 2% of the country’s electricity needs, will be generated, along with more than 5,000 jobs."
"So it is clear that some countries now view environmental investments in infrastructure, energy systems, and ecosystems as among the best bets for recovery."
Others may be unsure about the potential returns from investing in ecosystem services such as forest carbon storage or in renewable energy for the 80% of Africans who have no access to electricity.
Still others may simply be unaware of how to precisely follow suit.
"In early February, the United Nations Environment Program will convene some of the world’s leading economists at the UN’s headquarters in New York."
"A strategy for a Global Green New Deal, tailored to different national challenges, will be fleshed out in order to assist world leaders and ministers craft stimulus packages that work on multiple fronts."
"The Global Green New Deal, which UNEP launched as a concept in October 2008, responds to the current economic malaise."
"Spent wisely, however, these stimulus packages could trigger far-reaching and transformational trends, setting the stage for a more sustainable, urgently needed Green Economy for the twenty-first century."
"The trillions of dollars that have been mobilized to address current woes, together with the trillions of investors’ dollars waiting in the wings, represent an opportunity that was unthinkable only 12 months ago: the chance to steer a more resource-efficient and intelligent course that can address problems ranging from climate change and natural-resource scarcity to water shortages and biodiversity loss."
Blindly pumping the current bail-out billions into old industries and exhausted economic models will be throwing good money after bad while mortgaging our children’s future.
"Instead, political leaders must use these windfalls to invest in innovation, promote sustainable businesses, and encourage new patterns of decent, long-lasting employment."
A Global Growth Bargain
LONDON – US President Barack Obama caught the imagination of the world when he talked recently of a new “Sputnik moment.”
"He outlined a bold plan for improving education, infrastructure, and technology, and vividly compared the resolve required to put a man on the moon to the determination needed to restore growth to the US economy."
"Obama is right to say that the West faces not only great challenges, but also great opportunities.&nbsp;In the last decade, the global economy was transformed by one billion Asian workers entering the ranks of industrial producers.&nbsp;In 2011, for the first time in two centuries, Europe and America face being out-produced, out-exported, and out-invested by China and the rest of the world."
Yet Asia’s growth also gives the West unprecedented economic hope.
"In this decade, the world will be transformed&nbsp;yet again by the rise of the Asian consumer.&nbsp;By 2020, Asia’s domestic markets will be twice the size of America’s."
The world’s middle class will have swelled from one billion consumers to three billion.
The opportunities for growth in Europe and the US from this additional global demand are enormous.
"The countries and companies that will flourish in Asia’s new markets will be those that can provide the technology-driven, custom-built, high value-added goods and services needed to serve Asia’s two billion consumers."
But neither Europe nor the US is in a strong enough position to take best advantage of these new markets.
"The West must again begin to out-invent, out-innovate, and out-skill the rest of the world if it is to seize the opportunities that Asia presents.&nbsp;Indeed, unless the West significantly expands its capital investment in engineering, science, and new technologies, it will be marginalized by countries whose governments back their innovators with hard cash."
Obama’s investment plan could be the foundation stone for a formal global agreement that delivers higher levels of growth to all corners of the world and creates millions of new jobs.
"Under such an agreement, Europe would join the US in raising levels of investment – complementing America’s “moonshot”&nbsp;initiative with a program of structural reform aimed at building a digital, green, energy-efficient, and competitive economy – while China would play its part by increasing its consumption."
I believe that such an agreement could boost the world economy by around 3% by 2014 – and lift 100 million people out of poverty.
I presented this plan when I chaired the G-20 in London in 2009.
I wanted East and West to commit to a formal strategy to deliver more enduring results than those promised by the rescue packages that we were putting together at the time.
Our attention was focused on preventing recession from turning into depression.
I argued that this was also the moment to pioneer a more lasting framework of growth.
"In the end, no agreement was possible on a shared growth objective, and there has not yet&nbsp;been enough political will for the coordinated action to achieve it."
"Since then, Europe and America have grown well below their capacity (despite huge unmet demand throughout the world) and unemployment has climbed to around 10% on both continents (with youth unemployment reaching an alarming 20%)."
The global growth agreement that evaded us in 2009 remains the unfinished work of the G-20.
Front-loaded public investment could be funded through an enhanced European Investment Bank.
China has already laid the foundation for playing its part: its policy of xiaokang (reducing poverty and expanding the middle class) should create a market for billions of dollars of&nbsp;Western goods and services.
"The West should propose that if China’s consumption increases by 2-4 percentage points of its GDP over the next three years (entirely possible as it improves its social safety net, cuts taxes, and puts homeownership within reach of ordinary citizens), America and Europe will expand their public investment by similar amounts."
"If other Asian countries do likewise, and agree to create a level playing field for exporters, we could create around 50 million additional jobs."
"Of course, in the West, an investment plan invites criticism from those who prefer that we do nothing but talk about growth strategies."
"Indeed, critics argue that raising public investment conflicts with the drive to reduce deficits, and warn of higher interest rates on the back of further spending."
But critics are wrong about the impact on the deficit&nbsp;of focused investment.
A recent study by the International Monetary Fund produced unequivocal evidence that we can actually maintain deficit-reduction plans while benefiting from the additional capital investment that the US and European economies need.
My extrapolation of the IMF model shows that Western countries can boost their long-term GDP growth significantly by increasing their levels of capital investment over a three-year period.
"An annual stimulus equivalent to just 0.3% of GDP yields a return in the US of 0.8% in economic growth at its peak in 2013, and 0.4% in Europe."
"This approach, which secures growth and cuts unemployment without raising the deficit, is needed to energize the private sector and mobilize some of the capital that has accumulated on corporate balance sheets in recent years."
It also underscores the importance of the G-20 and the IMF in seeking global consensus now.
The West is well placed to play its part in global renewal.
Its extraordinary workforces produce world-class goods and services. But the West’s workforce must not be condemned to policies that willfully produce a decade of slow growth and low employment.
"That would be a human tragedy, not just an economic disaster."
A Global Perfect Storm
"NEW YORK – Dark, lowering financial and economic clouds are, it seems, rolling in from every direction: the eurozone, the United States, China, and elsewhere."
"Indeed, the global economy in 2013 could be a very difficult environment in which to find shelter."
"For starters, the eurozone crisis is worsening, as the euro remains too strong, front-loaded fiscal austerity deepens recession in many member countries, and a credit crunch in the periphery and high oil prices undermine prospects of recovery."
"The eurozone banking system is becoming balkanized, as cross-border and interbank credit lines are cut off, and capital flight could turn into a full run on periphery banks if, as is likely, Greece stages a disorderly euro exit in the next few months."
"Moreover, fiscal and sovereign-debt strains are becoming worse as interest-rate spreads for Spain and Italy have returned to their unsustainable peak levels."
"Indeed, the eurozone may require not just an international bailout of banks (as recently in Spain), but also a full sovereign bailout at a time when eurozone and international firewalls are insufficient to the task of backstopping both Spain and Italy."
"As a result, disorderly breakup of the eurozone remains possible."
"Farther to the west, US economic performance is weakening, with first-quarter growth a miserly 1.9% – well below potential."
"And job creation faltered in April and May, so the US may reach stall speed by year end."
"Worse, the risk of a double-dip recession next year is rising: even if what looks like a looming US fiscal cliff turns out to be only a smaller source of drag, the likely increase in some taxes and reduction of some transfer payments will reduce growth in disposable income and consumption."
"Moreover, political gridlock over fiscal adjustment is likely to persist, regardless of whether Barack Obama or Mitt Romney wins November’s presidential election."
"Thus, new fights on the debt ceiling, risks of a government shutdown, and rating downgrades could further depress consumer and business confidence, reducing spending and accelerating a flight to safety that would exacerbate the fall in stock markets."
"In the east, China, its growth model unsustainable, could be underwater by 2013, as its investment bust continues and reforms intended to boost consumption are too little too late."
"A new Chinese leadership must accelerate structural reforms to reduce national savings and increase consumption’s share of GDP; but divisions within the leadership about the pace of reform, together with the likelihood of a bumpy political transition, suggest that reform will occur at a pace that simply is not fast enough."
"The economic slowdown in the US, the eurozone, and China already implies a massive drag on growth in other emerging markets, owing to their trade and financial links with the US and the European Union (that is, no “decoupling” has occurred)."
"At the same time, the lack of structural reforms in emerging markets, together with their move towards greater state capitalism, is hampering growth and will reduce their resiliency."
"Finally, long-simmering tensions in the Middle East between Israel and the US on one side and Iran on the other on the issue of nuclear proliferation could reach a boil by 2013."
"The current negotiations are likely to fail, and even tightened sanctions may not stop Iran from trying to build nuclear weapons."
"With the US and Israel unwilling to accept containment of a nuclear Iran by deterrence, a military confrontation in 2013 would lead to a massive oil price spike and global recession."
"These risks are already exacerbating the economic slowdown: equity markets are falling everywhere, leading to negative wealth effects on consumption and capital spending."
"Borrowing costs are rising for highly indebted sovereigns, credit rationing is undermining small and medium-size companies, and falling commodity prices are reducing exporting countries’ income."
Increasing risk aversion is leading economic agents to adopt a wait-and-see stance that makes the slowdown partly self-fulfilling.
"Compared to 2008-2009, when policymakers had ample space to act, monetary and fiscal authorities are running out of policy bullets (or, more cynically, policy rabbits to pull out of their hats)."
Monetary policy is constrained by the proximity to zero interest rates and repeated rounds of quantitative easing.
"Indeed, economies and markets no longer face liquidity problems, but rather credit and insolvency crises."
"Meanwhile, unsustainable budget deficits and public debt in most advanced economies have severely limited the scope for further fiscal stimulus."
Using exchange rates to boost net exports is a zero-sum game at a time when private and public deleveraging is suppressing domestic demand in countries that are running current-account deficits and structural issues are having the same effect in surplus countries.
"After all, a weaker currency and better trade balance in some countries necessarily implies a stronger currency and a weaker trade balance in others."
"Meanwhile, the ability to backstop, ring-fence, and bail out banks and other financial institutions is constrained by politics and near-insolvent sovereigns’ inability to absorb additional losses from their banking systems."
"As a result, sovereign risk is now becoming banking risk."
"Indeed, sovereigns are dumping a larger fraction of their public debt onto banks’ balance sheet, especially in the eurozone."
"To prevent a disorderly outcome in the eurozone, today’s fiscal austerity should be much more gradual, a growth compact should complement the EU’s new fiscal compact, and a fiscal union with debt mutualization (Eurobonds) should be implemented.&nbsp;"
"In addition, a full banking union, starting with eurozone-wide deposit insurance, should be initiated, and moves toward greater political integration must be considered, even as Greece leaves the eurozone."
"Unfortunately, Germany resists all of these key policy measures, as it is fixated on the credit risk to which its taxpayers would be exposed with greater economic, fiscal, and banking integration."
"As a result, the probability of a eurozone disaster is rising."
"And, while the cloud over the eurozone may be the largest to burst, it is not the only one threatening the global economy."
A Global Solutions Network
NEW YORK – Great social change occurs in several ways.
"A technological breakthrough – the steam engine, computers, the Internet – may play a leading role."
"Visionaries, such as Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and Nelson Mandela, may inspire a demand for justice."
"Political leaders may lead a broad reform movement, as with Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal."
Our own generation urgently needs to spur another era of great social change.
"This time, we must act to save the planet from a human-induced environmental catastrophe."
Each of us senses this challenge almost daily.
"Heat waves, droughts, floods, forest fires, retreating glaciers, polluted rivers, and extreme storms buffet the planet at a dramatically rising rate, owing to human activities."
Our $70-trillion-per-year global economy is putting unprecedented pressures on the natural environment.
"We will need new technologies, behaviors, and ethics, supported by solid evidence, to reconcile further economic development with environmental sustainability."
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is taking on this unprecedented challenge from his unique position at the crossroads of global politics and society.
"At the political level, the UN is the meeting place for 193 member states to negotiate and create international law, as in the important treaty on climate change adopted at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992."
"At the level of global society, the UN represents the world’s citizenry, “we the peoples,” as it says in the UN Charter.&nbsp; At the societal level, the UN is about the rights and responsibilities of all of us, including future generations."
"In the past two decades, governments have come up short on solutions to environmental threats."
Politicians have failed to implement properly the treaties adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit.
"Ban knows that strong government action remains vital, but he also recognizes that civil society must also play a larger role, especially because too many governments and politicians are beholden to vested interests, and too few politicians think in time horizons that extend past the next election."
"To empower global society to act, Ban has launched a bold new global initiative, for which I am grateful to volunteer."
The UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network is a powerful effort to mobilize global knowledge to save the planet.
"The idea is to use global networks of knowledge and action to identify and demonstrate new, cutting-edge approaches to sustainable development around the world."
"The network will work alongside and support governments, UN agencies, civil-society organizations, and the private sector."
"Humanity needs to learn new ways to produce and use low-carbon energy, grow food sustainably, build livable cities, and manage the global commons of oceans, biodiversity, and the atmosphere. But time is running very short."
"Today’s mega-cities, for example, already have to confront dangerous heat waves, rising sea levels, more extreme storms, dire congestion, and air and water pollution."
"Agricultural regions already need to become more resilient in the face of increased climate volatility. And as one region in one part of the world designs a better way to manage its transport, energy needs, water supplies, or food supplies, those successes should quickly become part of the global knowledge base, enabling other regions to benefit rapidly as well."
"Universities have a special role to play in the new UN knowledge network. Exactly 150 years ago, in 1862, Abraham Lincoln created America’s “land-grant” universities to help local communities to improve farming and the quality of life through science."
"Today, we need universities in all parts of the world to help their societies face the challenges of poverty reduction, clean energy, sustainable food supplies, and the rest."
"By linking together, and putting their curricula online, the world’s universities can become even more effective in discovering and promoting science-based solutions to complex problems."
The world’s corporate sector also has a significant role to play in sustainable development.
Now the corporate sector has two faces.
"It is the repository of cutting-edge sustainable technologies, pioneering research and development, world-class management, and leadership in environmental sustainability. Yet at the same time, the corporate sector lobbies aggressively to gut environmental regulations, slash corporate-tax rates, and avoid their own responsibility for ecological destruction."
Sometimes the same company operates on both sides of the divide.
We urgently need far-sighted companies to join the Sustainable Development Solutions Network.
"These companies are uniquely placed to move new ideas and technologies into early-stage demonstration projects, thereby accelerating global learning cycles."
"Equally important, we need a critical mass of respected corporate leaders to press their peers to cease the anti-environmental lobbying and campaign-finance practices that account for the inaction of governments.&nbsp;"
"Sustainable development is a generational challenge, not a short-term task."
"The reinvention of energy, food, transport, and other systems will take decades, not years. But the long-term nature of this challenge must not lull us into inaction."
"We must start reinventing our productive systems now, precisely because the path of change will be so long and the environmental dangers are already so pressing.&nbsp;"
"At the Rio+20 Summit this past June, the world’s governments agreed to adopt a new set of goals on sustainable development for the period after 2015, to build upon the Millennium Development Goals’ success in reducing poverty, hunger, and disease."
"In the post-2015 era, the fight against poverty and the fight to protect the environment will go hand in hand, reinforcing each other."
"Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has already initiated several global processes to help establish the new post-2015 goals in an open, participatory, and knowledge-based way.&nbsp;"
The Secretary General’s launch of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network is therefore especially timely.
"Not only will the world adopt a new set of goals to achieve sustainable development, but it will also have a new global network of expertise to help achieve those vital objectives.&nbsp;"
A Good Rate Hike for Europe
Two wrongs don’t make a right.
Just because European governments have failed to put bread on their constituents’ tables doesn’t mean that the European Central Bank should likewise fail in its job of promoting price stability in the euro zone.
"That may sound obvious, but abandoning price stability is exactly what some European politicians are advocating."
"For example, Italian politicians, who, given Italy’s recent dismal economic performance, would seem the least qualified to offer the ECB advice on monetary policy, are nonetheless advocating interest-rate cuts."
"Echoing comments by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Deputy Economics Minister Mario Baldassarri said in Il Sole 24 Ore last week that all efforts to boost growth are in vain “if someone is pushing on the brake pedal.”"
Who’s he kidding?
If anyone is “pushing down on the Italian growth brake” it is Berlusconi himself.
He has made no efforts at economic reform during his term and now seeks to blame the ECB for Italy’s lame economic performance.
But it is precisely the lack of economic reform at home that has made Italy one of the least competitive states in the euro-zone economy.
More than the usual “blame game” is at work here.
Pressures are mounting on the ECB to raise interest rates – and Berlusconi and Co.’s attacks are as much as an attempt to forestall future rate hikes as to get the ECB to loosen its monetary policy.
"Soaring energy prices, for example, have become a leading inflation risk. But higher energy prices, by themselves, will not cause the ECB to pull the interest-rate trigger."
The key will be so-called “second-round effects” – whether growing crude prices lead to higher wage demands from trade unions.
"So far, the “social partners,” as ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet likes to call the unions, have been quiet."
"Should this change, the ECB will have to raise rates even if Europe’s economic growth remains slack."
The good news is that economic growth in the euro-zone economy appears to be picking up (even in Italy).
Though second-quarter GDP growth was weak — the euro-zone average was only 0.3% year on year – third-quarter data are indicating a sustained economic pick-up in the second half of the year.
Only consumption is lagging.
How will the ECB react to better economic news?
"Some on the Governing Council have grown uncomfortable that euro-zone interest rates have stayed so low, at 2%, for so long (more than two years). True, there is no inflation problem in the short run, but the ECB’s monetary policy focuses on the medium term."
"One particular worry is that euro-zone money supply is well above the ECB’s benchmark level, indicating an excess supply of liquidity. It is doubtful that the ECB would raise interest rates to curb excess liquidity so long as economic recovery remains in question."
"This will change, however, once the economic pick-up is confirmed. Interest-rate hikes may be coming sooner rather than later, which is why Berlusconi and French President Jacques Chirac are talking up interest-rate cuts now."
"Meanwhile, in Germany, the elections this September may have surprising consequences for ECB monetary policy."
"Angela Merkel, the Christian Democrats’ candidate, is a reformer, holding out hope for Germany’s future – and that of Europe."
"Unfortunately, Merkel’s campaign is off to a rocky start, and the recent entry of Oskar Lafontaine’s extreme left-wing party into the fray may necessitate the formation of a grand coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats."
"This would be bad news for the German economy, which could delay possible ECB interest rate hikes. Because the expected gridlock in parliament would make reforms less likely, companies might hold off on investment, while consumers would be more likely to keep their wallets closed, because official policy would be even less clear than it is now."
"On the other hand, a center-right coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Free Democrats could spark the ECB into action."
This raises an interesting point.
"The public should be relieved if the ECB raises rates, because this would most likely signal that the long-awaited economic recovery is well under way, and that inflationary repercussions are being addressed."
"A hike, in other words, would indicate that good things are happening."
But the public often views interest-rate increases as negative events that increase unemployment and stifle growth.
"Blame-game politicians like Berlusconi, who have failed to put bread on the table, their minions in the media, and Keynesian economic professors who don’t understand and misrepresent Keynes sustain this distorted view."
Europe would be a lot better off if someone told the public the truth.
A Grand Bargain with Iran
"The specter of a nuclear Iran haunts Arabs and Israelis alike, but it is the United States and Israel that are the driving force behind efforts to curtail Iran’s nuclear ambitions."
The America-Iran-Israel triangle is where the clue to the problem and its possible solution lie.
"Though Ayatollah Khomeini’s Islamic revolution in 1979 disrupted Israel’s old alliance with Iran, the two countries continued to conduct business with America’s blessing."
"The Iran-Contra affair of the 1980’s, through which Israel supplied arms to the Islamic Republic in its war against Iraq is a case in point."
"Israel and Iran, two non-Arab powers in a hostile Arab environment, shared fundamental interests that the Islamic revolution could not change."
"It was during Yitzhak Rabin’s government in the early 1990’s that Israel and Iran entered into open conflict, owing to the changing strategic environment after America’s victory in the first Gulf War and the collapse of the Soviet Union."
"The US-sponsored Arab-Israeli peace process, which produced a series of breathtaking achievements – the Madrid peace conference, the Oslo accords, Israel’s peace agreement with Jordan, a near-rapprochement with Syria, and Israel’s inroads into Arab states from Morocco to Qatar – was an increasingly isolated Iran’s worst nightmare."
"It was at that crossroads that Israel and Iran, two powers vying for mastery in a rapidly changing Middle East, chose to cast their strategic competition in ideological terms."
"The conflict was now between Israel, a beacon of democracy fighting the expansion of a Shiite obscurantist empire, and an Iran that chose to protect its revolution by mobilizing the Arab masses in the name of Islamic values and against treacherous rulers who had betrayed the dispossessed Palestinians."
"More an enemy of Israeli-Arab reconciliation than of Israel as such, the Mullahs’ resort to an incendiary anti-Jewish, pan-Islamic discourse is aimed at ending Iran’s isolation and presenting its regional ambitions in a light palatable to the Sunni masses."
"In an Arab Middle East, Iran is the natural enemy; in an Islamic world, Iran is a potential leader."
"Ironically, Iran has been the main supporter of Arab democracy, for the best way to undermine the incumbent regimes is to promote popularly based Islamist movements such as Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Hamas in Palestine, and the Shiite majority in Iraq."
"Yitzhak Rabin believed that an Israeli-Arab peace could prevent a nuclear Iran, but now his nightmare seems rapidly approaching."
"As an anti-status quo power, Iran is not pursuing nuclear capabilities in order to destroy Israel, but to gain prestige and influence in a hostile environment and as a shield for its challenge to the regional order."
"But Israel has every reason to be concerned, for a nuclear Iran would undermine the promise of Zionism to secure a Jewish refuge – the core rationale of Israel’s own strategy of “nuclear ambiguity” – and would embolden its enemies throughout the region."
"It would also trigger uncontrolled regional nuclear proliferation, with Saudi Arabia and Egypt leading the way."
"A military attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities is too dangerous, and its results uncertain. And, however severe economic sanctions might be, they might not bring Iran to its knees."
Nor is it clear that the split within the Iranian elite between revolutionary purists and those with a merchant-class mentality would lead to regime change any time soon.
"However, being radical does not necessarily mean being irrational, and revolutionary Iran has given frequent proof of its pragmatism."
"In the American-Iranian equation it was the US, not Iran, that conducted rigid ideological diplomacy."
"Iran backed the US during the first Gulf War, but was left out of the Madrid peace conference."
"Iran also supported America in its war to depose the Taliban in Afghanistan. And, when US forces overran Saddam Hussein’s army in the spring of 2003, the encircled Iranians proposed a grand bargain that would put all contentious issues on the table, from the nuclear issue to Israel, from Hezbollah to Hamas."
The Iranians also pledged to stop obstructing the Israeli-Arab peace process.
"But, neo-conservative haughtiness – “We don’t speak to evil” – ruled out a pragmatic response to Iran’s demarche."
"Iran’s mood changed by the time America’s entire Middle East strategy had gone adrift, but the grand bargain remains the only viable way out of the impasse."
"This would not be achieved, however, through an inevitably imperfect sanctions regime, or by America’s resort to Cold War logic aimed at breaking Iran’s backbone by drawing it into a ruinous arms race."
"Iran’s growing regional influence does not stem from its military expenditures, which are far lower than those of its enemies, but from its challenge to America and Israel through an astute use of soft power."
"There is no better way to undercut Iran’s regional strategy of destabilization than a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace, accompanied by massive investments in human development, and followed by an internationally sponsored system of peace and security in a verifiably nuclear-free Middle East, including Israel."
A Gravity Test for the Euro
"CAMBRIDGE – Although I appreciate that exchange rates are never easy to explain or understand, I find today’s relatively robust value for the euro somewhat mysterious."
Do the gnomes of currency markets seriously believe that the eurozone governments’ latest “comprehensive package” to save the euro will hold up for more than a few months?
The new plan relies on a questionable mix of dubious financial-engineering gimmicks and vague promises of modest Asian funding.
"Even the best part of the plan, the proposed (but not really agreed) 50% haircut for private-sector holders of Greek sovereign debt, is not sufficient to stabilize that country’s profound debt and growth problems."
"So how is it that the euro is trading at a 40% premium to the US dollar, even as investors continue to view southern European government debt with great skepticism?"
"I can think of one very good reason why the euro needs to fall, and six not-so-convincing reasons why it should remain stable or appreciate."
Let’s begin with why the euro needs to fall.
"Absent a clear path to a much tighter fiscal and political union, which can lead only through constitutional change, the current halfway house of the euro system appears increasingly untenable."
It seems clear that the European Central Bank will be forced to buy far greater quantities of eurozone sovereign (junk) bonds.
"That may work in the short term, but if sovereign default risks materialize – as my research with Carmen Reinhart suggests is likely – the ECB will in turn have to be recapitalized."
"And, if the stronger northern eurozone countries are unwilling to digest this transfer – and political resistance runs high – the ECB may be forced to recapitalize itself through money creation."
"Either way, the threat of a profound financial crisis is high."
"Given this, what arguments support the current value of the euro, or its further rise?"
"First, investors might be telling themselves that in the worst-case scenario, the northern European countries will effectively push out the weaker countries, creating a super-euro."
"But, while this scenario has a certain ring of truth, surely any breakup would be highly traumatic, with the euro diving before its rump form recovered."
"Second, investors may be remembering that even though the dollar was at the epicenter of the 2008 financial panic, the consequences radiated so widely that, paradoxically, the dollar actually rose in value."
"Although it may be difficult to connect the dots, it is perfectly possible that a huge euro crisis could have a snowball effect in the US and elsewhere."
"Perhaps the transmission mechanism would be through US banks, many of which remain vulnerable, owing to thin capitalization and huge portfolios of mortgages booked far above their market value."
"Third, foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds may be keen to keep buying up euros to hedge against risks to the US and their own economies."
Government investors are not necessarily driven by the return-maximizing calculus that motivates private investors.
"If foreign official demand is the real reason behind the euro’s strength, the risk is that foreign sovereign euro buyers will eventually flee, just as private investors would, only in a faster and more concentrated way."
"Fourth, investors may believe that, ultimately, US risks are just as large as Europe’s."
"True, the US political system seems stymied in coming up with a plan to stabilize medium-term budget deficits."
"Whereas the US Congress’s “supercommittee,” charged with formulating a fiscal-consolidation package, will likely come up with a proposal, it is far from clear that either Republicans or Democrats will be willing to accept compromise in an election year."
"Moreover, investors might be worried that the US Federal Reserve will weigh in with a third round of “quantitative easing,” which would further drive down the dollar."
"Fifth, the current value of the euro does not seem wildly out of line on a purchasing-power basis.&#160;"
"An exchange rate of $1.4:€1 is cheap for Germany’s export powerhouse, which could probably operate well even with a far stronger euro."
"For the eurozone’s southern periphery, however, today’s euro rate is very difficult to manage."
"Whereas some German companies persuaded workers to accept wage cuts to help weather the financial crisis, wages across the southern periphery have been marching steadily upwards, even as productivity has remained stagnant."
"But, because the overall value of the euro has to be a balance of the eurozone’s north and south, one can argue that 1.4 is within a reasonable range."
"Finally, investors might just believe that the eurozone leaders’ latest plan will work, even though the last dozen plans have failed."
"Abraham Lincoln is credited with saying “You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.”"
"A comprehensive euro fix will surely arrive for some of the countries at some time, but not for all of the countries anytime soon."
"So, yes, there are plenty of vaguely plausible reasons why the euro, despite its drawn-out crisis, has remained so firm against the dollar so far."
But don’t count on a stable euro-dollar exchange rate – much less an even stronger euro – in the year ahead.
A Greek Catch-22
BUENOS AIRES – Desperate times bring desperate measures.
The latest package to cope with Greece’s insolvency offers a bond buyback to lighten the country’s debt burden.
"In essence, this is a back-door debt restructuring: Europe’s bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) would lend the money for Greece to buy back its own debt in the secondary market at deep discounts, thereby imposing a loss on private bondholders without the need to declare a default."
A recurrent characteristic of Europe’s debt-crisis debate is a Latin American precedent.
"Indeed, many highly indebted countries in Latin America conducted similar debt buybacks in the late 1980’s."
"Bolivia’s 1988 buyback of close to half of its defaulted sovereign debt, an operation funded by international donors, is a classic example."
But the most relevant Latin American experience with debt buybacks is a more recent and far less studied case: Ecuador in 2008.
"President Rafael Correa had been toying with default since the 2006 presidential campaign (debt repudiation was part of his platform), and quickly earned a CCC rating from Fitch."
The reasons invoked by Correa (legal concerns about how the bonds were issued in the 2000 debt exchange) were beside the point.
"The default threat was a way to depress bond prices in secondary markets, only to buy them back at a discount through the back door."
"That task was outsourced to Banco del Pacífico, which bought the soon-to-be-defaulted Ecuadorian paper at 20 cents on the dollar and above – a level low enough for a deep haircut but high enough to fend off “vulture” investors."
"To speed things up, after the default was declared in December 2008, Ecuador completed the buyback with an inverse auction for the remaining bondholders, to be settled in cash – rather than a regular exchange in which the legality of undercover purchases was likely to be questioned."
"With the larger part of the outstanding stock in friendly hands, and institutional bondholders pressed to liquidate their positions in the midst of the post-Lehman Brothers selloff, the operation was a success."
This episode offers a few preliminary lessons on debt buybacks.
The first concerns the market response.
"Judging from the recent evolution of Ecuadorian bond yields, it appears that markets have not punished Ecuador’s behavior: Ecuador, an oil exporter blessed by the 2009 recovery in oil prices, could have returned to the capital markets shortly after the exchange."
"This is particularly notable, given that Ecuador’s was perhaps the first opportunistic default (triggered by unwillingness, rather than inability, to pay) in recent history."
"The second lesson, and the one most pertinent to Europe now, concerns the crucial role played by the default scenario."
"Indeed, almost two years of default threats by Correa were not enough to elicit a deep discount."
Ecuador needed to go all the way to a “credit event” in December 2008 to be able to purchase the bonds at bargain prices.
"The premise that only a credible default ensures significant private-sector involvement (that is, that private bondholders take a real hit) is apparent when we compare the market-friendly Uruguayan debt exchange in 2003 with the draconian Argentine restructuring of 2005."
"In Uruguay, what the authorities presented as a voluntary transaction produced no nominal haircuts and only minor debt relief; in Argentina, a four-year debt moratorium was essential to achieving nominal haircuts above 50%."
So the question arises: how are private bondholders to be convinced to get rid of their Greek bonds at a loss if there is a credible buyer of last resort?
"If Europe credibly volunteered funds to buy back all Greek debt, the Greek risk premium would disappear and private investors would be fully bailed out."
Only the probability of a default – and the goal of avoiding even deeper haircuts – can induce investors to liquidate their positions at a discount.
But the buyback can succeed only if the market perceives it as the last chance before a unilateral debt restructuring.
"In other words, a successful buyback is a preamble to default."
"Can Greece, with the EFSF’s help, obtain debt relief while avoiding default?"
"Small purchases at current panic prices, vulture-fund style, are always possible, but they do not promise substantial debt relief."
"Large purchases would drive up prices in the secondary market, defeating the point of the whole operation."
"And the opaque Ecuadorian methods are not possible in Europe, both for legal reasons and because a transaction of this size could hardly be disguised or outsourced."
"But what if the EFSF were to mimic Banco del Pacífico in a transparent way, say, by setting a threshold spread level above which it would fund buy-backs of any Greek bond in the market?"
"Naturally, the spread would automatically converge to the threshold, but how much would be sold?"
Would the EFSF be retiring Greek debt at bargain prices or would it be providing insurance to current bondholders?
"If the threshold spread is set reasonably high in order to achieve a significant discount, the stock of debt retired by the buyback would be marginal."
"After all, by capping spreads, the buyback facility would limit the downside risk while providing incentives to hold the bonds and wait for the upside – a good reason, perhaps, to make the facility a temporary offer."
"By contrast, if the threshold is set low enough to bring spreads down from panic levels, purchases will be more substantive, but at the expense of reducing considerably the effective haircut on private holders."
"A debt buyback is something of a Catch 22: to succeed in inducing a haircut, it needs to profit from the default fears that it intends to alleviate."
"Without Ecuador’s gimmicks, buybacks do not seem to be the solution to Greece’s debt overhang."
A Green Alternative to Austerity?
"OXFORD – While austerity in Europe faces increasing social resistance, in principle it has the merit of simplicity."
"As the debate on fiscal consolidation versus growth intensifies, it is clear that there is little agreement on how to kick-start the economy, beyond fielding broad stimulus packages."
One idea is that environmental technology might feed a virtuous cycle of innovation and employment.
"To some, green growth evokes a countryside covered with windmills and urban roofs lined with solar panels. But it is broader than that."
"For example, when Airbus moved from injection molding to 3D printing to produce the metal hinges for its airplanes’ doors, it reduced their weight by half, yielding phenomenal savings in material and associated fuel consumption over a lifetime of flying those hinges around the world."
"Still, it is easier to find exciting anecdotes than it is to show how they scale up to revitalizing an entire economy."
"Moreover, there is a great diversity of narratives on the green economy – and their proliferation is likely to grow."
"This June, thousands of activists, policymakers, and business people will converge on Rio de Janeiro for the third giant United Nations Sustainable Development Conference (Rio+20), whose theme is the green economy."
"The conference will unleash new arguments about green jobs, growth, cost increases, cost reductions, changes in values, consumer choice – green this and green that."
"As a co-author of A New Growth Path for Europe, a report commissioned by the German government, I am guilty of contributing to this cacophony of complementary perspectives on green growth."
"The European Climate Foundation had already published its Roadmap 2050, A Practical Guide to a Prosperous, Low-Carbon Europe."
"Since then, the UN Environment Program has released its Green Economy Report;"
McKinsey has written about the Resource Revolution; and the International Trade Unions Council has published Growing Green and Decent Jobs – to name but a few.
"All take somewhat different approaches and offer different recommendations, making it hard for policymakers to see the forest through the trees. And, at the root of this multiplicity of perspectives lays the fact that economics struggles to explain how growth and innovation move an economy as a whole."
"The macroeconomic models on which policymakers depend are solid tools in times of smooth and incremental evolution, but green growth is not about gradual change."
"For example, the European Union’s goal of achieving an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 implies a complete overhaul of EU infrastructure in just a few decades."
"Economists’ inability to model such rapid, radical change should not be taken as a condemnation of the discipline; it is simply a reflection of the state of our knowledge, and of the fact that the economy is really, really complicated."
"We simply do not yet have sufficiently precise insights into how all of its elements interact during times of far-reaching change, whether it be a financial crisis or a growth spurt."
"Yet, the studies of green growth mentioned above all appear to provide such explanations."
"So, what do they really tell us?"
"In practice, each is limited to just one or two aspects of the economy, and describes how these interact."
Growing Green and Decent Jobs looks at the relationship between investment and jobs.
A New Growth Path for Europe examines the impact of expectations and learning-by-doing.
Roadmap 2050 focuses on greening the power system.
The authors then make a leap of faith to derive conclusions about the economy as a whole.
"But, while the value of these studies is in the light that they shed on the parts, the ensuing headlines invariably are about the whole, articulated in terms of GDP and jobs."
"Each of the studies describes a part of a green economy, but none can capture the whole – not because they are deficient, but because it is simply beyond our capability."
"That said, the fact that one cannot prove conclusively how green growth would work does not mean that we should give up on the idea."
"We know from history that waves of innovation, from the steam engine to the information and communications revolution, have led to dramatic increases in economic growth."
"We cannot prove that a wave of environmental innovation will have a similar effect, but the studies of the parts make such an outcome highly plausible."
"As humans, we are uniquely equipped to make decisions on the basis of ambiguous information – in fact, we do it all the time."
"When we choose a career or a spouse in our private lives, or when a politician seizes an opportunity from a plethora of possibilities, the task at hand is always about making highly consequential decisions based on imperfect information."
A big pile of green-growth reports demonstrates the plausibility of this path to recovery from an historic economic crisis.
It is now up to us to realize its potential.
Green growth offers a realistic alternative to the faltering austerity approach to overcoming the current economic crisis.
Policymakers should incorporate this thinking into the “beyond austerity” narrative that is taking shape in a growing number of key EU member states.
A Green Return to European Growth
THE HAGUE – Mitigating climate change is often presented as imposing a trade-off between the economy and the environment.
"For too long, the debate has been framed around the concept of “burden-sharing.”"
"But new analysis by a team from six leading European universities and institutes casts new light on this debate, and shows that Europe can make choices that are in its own best economic and environmental interest."
"The analysis contained in our new report, A New Growth Path for Europe – Generating Prosperity and Jobs in the Low-Carbon Economy, is based on a comprehensive assessment of European growth prospects in the aftermath of the financial crisis."
"Its publication is timely, because the European Union will decide this year whether to raise its target for greenhouse-gas reduction."
Increasing the current emissions target from -20% to -30% by 2020 compared to 1990 would represent an important opportunity to revitalize the European economy – independently of what the rest of the world did in terms of climate policy.
"Over the coming decade, seizing that opportunity would increase the size of Europe’s economy considerably – by up to 5% over the next decade."
This translates into six million new jobs and an increase in GDP of up to €800 billion by 2020.
"The reason for these results is straightforward: increasing Europe’s climate-policy efforts boosts investments, thus inducing learning-by-doing, especially when these efforts are channeled into new technologies like renewable energy and advanced construction materials."
"Learning-by-doing, in turn, increases competitiveness and spurs economic growth, thereby improving investors’ expectations – and inducing further investment."
"Unfortunately, studies of the economic impact of a -30% target have relied on traditional equilibrium models that neglect these multiplier effects."
"Their estimates of the economic consequences of raising the target result in moderate additional costs, ranging from 0-2% of GDP in 2020."
The new study uses an approach similar to that underpinning Germany’s 2020 emissions-reduction target of -40%.
"At last year’s United Nations-sponsored climate-change conference in Cancún, Mexico, German Federal Environment Minister Norbert Röttgen noted that, “In Germany, there has been a shift in thinking over the past years: in industry, politics, and society, we now see climate policy as an opportunity and challenge, not as a threat.”"
Röttgen is right.
Imagine a gathering of textile entrepreneurs in 1800 debating whether to introduce steam machines to mechanize their cotton mills.
One of them calculates that the costs would be prohibitive across their hundreds of plants.
"If the rest accepted this bottom-up calculation, society would miss out on the 0.5% boost to annual growth that this radical innovation ultimately brought about."
The benefit to the entire economy was bigger than the sum of the benefits for the individual mills.
It was not the invention of the steam engine alone that deserves the credit.
"Then as now, such breakthroughs generate a cascade of learning and innovation as suppliers, contractors. and customers adapt to a new way of operating."
"Every new major technological idea – the steam engine, railways, or the personal computer – adds up to a boost to growth."
A New Growth Path for Europe shows how investing in energy efficiency and clean energy has the same potential to revitalize Europe today.
"Indeed, Josef Ackermann, Chairman of Deutsche Bank, recently said that such investments augur “a new industrial revolution – a revolution that will transform the way we live.”"
The analysis shows how all major economic sectors – including many energy-intensive industries – will grow.
"For example, energy-efficient buildings are a boon to the cement and chemical industries."
"Obviously, the fossil-fuel sector would shrink by 2020 as the energy system decarbonizes, with coal being partly displaced by lower-carbon fuels, mainly gas and renewables (carbon capture and storage and nuclear power cannot make much of a difference by 2020)."
"The new EU member states, which have lower energy efficiency, stand to benefit the most – though substantial hurdles must be overcome with additional support mechanisms."
"Because the financial crisis has lowered greenhouse-gas emissions, the -20% reduction target set before the crisis is no longer challenging enough to catalyze a structural shift in the European economy."
"And, as scientists become gloomier and underline the urgency of tackling climate change, economists are becoming increasingly optimistic about the opportunities implied by a low-carbon future."
"A New Growth Path for Europe supports that optimism, and it calls on the EU to act accordingly."
Ethics and Agriculture
MELBOURNE – Should rich countries – or investors based there – be buying agricultural land in developing countries?
"That question is raised in Transnational Land Deals for Agriculture in the Global South, a report issued last year by the Land Matrix Partnership, a consortium of European research institutes and nongovernmental organizations."
"The report shows that since 2000, investors or state bodies in rich or emerging countries have bought more than 83 million hectares (more than 200 million acres) of agricultural land in poorer developing countries."
This amounts to 1.7% of the world’s agricultural land.
"Most of these purchases have been made in Africa, with two-thirds taking place in countries where hunger is widespread and institutions for establishing formal land ownership are often weak."
The purchases in Africa alone amount to an area of agricultural land the size of Kenya.
"It has been claimed that foreign investors are purchasing land that has been left idle; thus, by bringing it into production, the purchases are increasing the availability of food overall."
"But the Land Matrix Partnership report found that this is not the case: roughly 45% of the purchases involved existing croplands, and almost a third of the purchased land was forested, indicating that its development may pose risks for biodiversity."
"The investments are both private and public (for example, by state-owned entities) and come from three different groups of countries: emerging economies like China, India, Brazil, South Africa, Malaysia, and South Korea; oil-rich Gulf states; and wealthy developed economies like the United States and several European countries."
"On average, per capita income in the countries that are the source of these investments is four times higher than in the target countries."
"Most of the investments are aimed at producing food or other crops for export from the countries in which the land is acquired, for the obvious reason that richer countries can pay more for the output."
More than 40% of such projects aim to export food to the source country – suggesting that food security is a major reason for buying the land.
Oxfam International calls some of these deals “land grabs.”
"Its own report, Our Land, Our Lives,indicates that, since 2008, communities affected by World Bank projects have brought 21 formal complaints alleging violations of their land rights."
"Oxfam, drawing attention to large-scale land acquisitions that have entailed direct rights violations, has called on the Bank to freeze investments in land purchases until it can set standards ensuring that local communities are informed of them in advance, with the option of refusing them."
Oxfam also wants the Bank to ensure that these land deals do not undermine either local or national food security.
"In response, the World Bank agreed that there are instances of abuse in land acquisition, particularly in developing countries in which governance is weak, and said that it supported more transparent and inclusive participation."
"At the same time, it pointed to the need to increase food production to feed the extra two billion people expected to be alive in 2050, and suggested that more investment in agriculture in developing countries is required to improve productivity."
"The Bank rejected the idea of a moratorium on its own work with investors in agriculture, arguing that this would target precisely those who are most likely to do the right thing."
One may ask whether transparency and the requirement that local landholders consent to a sale is enough to protect people living in poverty.
"Supporters of free markets will argue that if local landowners wish to sell their land, that is their choice to make.&#160;"
"But, given the pressures of poverty and the lure of cash, what does it take for people to be able to make a genuinely free and informed choice about selling something as significant as a right to land?"
"After all, we do not allow poor people to sell their kidneys to the highest bidder."
"Of course, hardline supporters of free markets will say that we should."
"But, at the very least, it needs to be explained why people should be prohibited from selling kidneys, but not from selling the land that grows their food."
Most people can live without one kidney. No one can live without food.
"Why does the purchase of body parts give rise to international condemnation, while the purchase of agricultural land does not – even when it involves evicting local landholders and producing food for export to rich countries instead of for local consumption?"
The World Bank may indeed be more concerned about local landholders’ rights than other foreign investors are.
"If so, the 21 complaints made against Bank projects are most likely the visible tip of a vast iceberg of violations of land rights by foreign investors in agricultural projects in developing countries – with the others remaining invisible because victims have no access to any complaint procedure."
One such case belatedly came to the attention of the United Nations Human Rights Committee.
"In November, the Committee concluded that Germany had failed to police the Neumann Kaffee Gruppe regarding its complicity in the forced eviction of several villages in Uganda to make way for a large coffee plantation."
"But the evictions took place in 2001, and the villagers are still living in extreme poverty."
"They found no remedy, in either Uganda or Germany, for the violation of rights that, according to the Committee, they possess under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Germany is a signatory."
Are we to believe that landholders fare better with Chinese or Saudi investors?
Israel versus America versus Iran
TEL AVIV – Israel’s concern about the specter of a nuclear Iran has now degenerated into a crisis of confidence concerning the United States.
"Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has embarked on a campaign to force President Barack Obama to set a red line that Iran must not cross, lest it risk unleashing an American military response."
"Implicit threats of a unilateral Israeli attack, together with conspicuous meddling in the US presidential election campaign, have compounded Netanyahu’s effort to twist Obama’s arm."
"The controversy between the two allies partly reflects their divergent timelines: for Israel, the red line is Iran’s imminent burial deep underground of its uranium-enrichment facilities; for the US, it is the start of a dedicated weapons program."
"But, equally important, the dispute underscores their different objectives."
"For Israel, war with Iran is not about neutralizing an existential threat; it is about reasserting its regional status."
"Israel’s leaders see their country’s standing in the region being seriously threatened by the emergence of a hostile Islamist regime in Egypt; the possibility that a similarly hostile regime will eventually emerge in Syria; the fragility of traditionally friendly Jordan; and the dangerous boost that the regional Islamist awakening has given to Israel’s sworn enemies, Hamas and Hezbollah."
"Both Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak thus regard an attack on Iran as a major strategic move aimed at the broader Middle East, which implies that they would not discount a military campaign that goes well beyond surgical air strikes."
"Indeed, they probably contemplate land incursions into Iran, and possibly a decisive –&#160;and, from their perspective, long overdue – showdown with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon."
"Though determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, even if doing so requires military action, the US weighs the consequences of a military showdown in very different terms."
"A superpower that has earned only frustration in its abortive efforts – whether war or regional diplomacy – in the dysfunctional Middle East, the US faces the Iran crisis in the midst of its epochal strategic shift to Asia and the Pacific."
"The fallout from a war in Iran would pin down the US in the Middle East for years to come, undermining its new strategic priorities."
"As a result, the US, though certainly better equipped than Israel for a war to ensure that Iran forever abandons its nuclear ambitions, could nonetheless conclude that that objective is simply too costly."
"The recent report by The Iran Project, whose signatories include the former US national security advisers Brent Scowcroft and Zbigniew Brzezinski, concluded that an American military attack on Iran could only delay its nuclear program for up to four years."
"To guarantee that Iran never acquires a nuclear bomb, the US would need to maintain military pressure on Iran for several years."
"And, if forced to impose regime change as the ultimate solution to the dilemma, the report assumes that this would require military occupation, which would entail a commitment of resources and personnel greater than what the US invested in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined."
"Moreover, the conventional assumption that the region’s Sunni Arab regimes would give tacit approval to a military attack on Iran’s nuclear installations must be revisited in the wake of the Arab Spring – particularly in the aftermath of the recent, sudden upsurge in anti-American violence throughout the Muslim world."
The pre-Arab Spring paradigm that framed the Middle East as being divided between “moderates” and “extremists” has become obsolete.
"The Islamist governments that have emerged from the downfall of America’s puppet regimes are no friends of an Iranian nuclear empire. But, in their struggle to survive, they must channel popular anti-Americanism."
"For Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, that imperative meant placating the angry mob that recently attacked the US embassy rather than merely condemning the violence."
"An attack on Iran, especially if it develops into a longer war involving regional proxies, is bound to become the trigger for mass anti-Israel and anti-US hysteria, which might draw the Islamist regimes in the region into a dynamic of escalation."
It would be impossible to rule out a regional war.
The main problem facing a military operation in Iran is the need to ensure its legitimacy.
China and Russia would never allow the US to secure a United Nations mandate for an attack.
"Moreover, while Iranian provocations that clearly reveal the regime’s intentions to develop a nuclear-weapons capability might help build support for American military action, it is far from certain that Europeans, or others, would rush to join another US-led “coalition of the willing.”"
The dire legacy of Iraq and Afghanistan weighs heavily on the Western democracies.
The saddest part of the story is Israel’s utter indifference to the need to build international legitimacy for its drive to stop Iran’s nuclear program.
"Netanyahu thinks in bold military terms, not in terms of geopolitical strategy."
"His careless Palestine policy has left Israel with few friends in the international community, let alone in the Arab Middle East."
"Indeed, many regard Netanyahu’s Iran obsession as nothing more than a successful ploy to divert attention from the Palestinian issue."
"Only a generous, bold peace initiative that would genuinely revive the two-state solution, accompanied by a freeze on construction and enlargement of West Bank settlements, would help to recover the good will of the Palestinians and their brethren throughout the Arab world."
A Human Rights Crime In Gaza
Atlanta &#45;&#45;
"The world is witnessing a terrible human rights crime in Gaza, where a million and a half human beings are being imprisoned with almost no access to the outside world by sea, air, or land. An entire population is being brutally punished."
"This gross mistreatment of the Palestinians in Gaza was escalated dramatically by Israel, with United States backing, after political candidates representing Hamas won a majority of seats in the Palestinian Authority parliament in 2006."
The election was unanimously judged to be honest and fair by all international observers.
"Israel and the US refused to accept the right of Palestinians to form a unity government with Hamas and Fatah and now, after internal strife, Hamas alone controls Gaza. Forty-one of the 43 victorious Hamas candidates who lived in the West Bank are now imprisoned by Israel, plus an additional ten who assumed positions in the short-lived coalition cabinet."
"Regardless of one’s choice in the partisan struggle between Fatah and Hamas within occupied Palestine, we must remember that economic sanctions and restrictions in delivering water, food, electricity, and fuel are causing extreme hardship among the innocent people in Gaza, about one million of whom are refugees."
"Israeli bombs and missiles periodically strike the encapsulated area, causing high casualties among both militants and innocent women and children."
"Prior to the highly publicized killing of a woman and her four little children last week, this pattern was illustrated by a previous report from B’Tselem, the leading Israeli human rights organization: 106 Palestinians were killed between February 27 and March 3."
"Fifty-four of them were civilians who didn't take part in the fighting, and 25 were under 18 years of age."
"On a recent trip through the Middle East, I attempted to gain a better understanding of the crisis."
"One of my visits was to Sderot, a community of about 20,000 in southern Israel that is frequently struck by rudimentary rockets fired from nearby Gaza."
"I condemned these attacks as abominable and an act of terrorism, since most of the thirteen victims during the past seven years have been non-combatants."
"Subsequently, I met with leaders of Hamas, both a delegation from Gaza and the top officials in Damascus, Syria."
"I made the same condemnation to them, and urged that they declare a unilateral ceasefire or orchestrate with Israel a mutual agreement to terminate all military action in and around Gaza for an extended period."
"They responded that such previous action by them had not been reciprocated, and they reminded me that Hamas had previously insisted on a ceasefire throughout Palestine including both Gaza and the West Bank, which Israel had refused."
"Hamas then made a public proposal of a mutual ceasefire restricted to Gaza, which the Israelis considered and also rejected."
There are fervent arguments heard on both sides concerning blame for a lack of peace in the Holy Land.
"Israel has occupied and colonized the Palestinian West Bank, which is approximately one-fourth (28.5%) the size of the nation of Israel as recognized by the international community."
"Some Israeli religious factions claim a right to the land on both sides of the Jordan River, and others aver that their 205 settlements with some 500,000 people are necessary for “security.”"
All Arab nations have agreed to full recognition of Israel if it will comply with key United Nations resolutions.
"Hamas has agreed to accept any negotiated peace settlement between Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, provided it is approved in a referendum among the Palestinian people."
"This holds promise of progress, but despite the brief fanfare and positive statements at the peace conference last November in Annapolis, Maryland, a retrogression has occurred in the process."
"Nine thousand new Israeli settlement housing units have been announced in Palestine, the number of roadblocks within the West bank has increased, and the stranglehold on Gaza has been tightened."
"It is one thing for other leaders to defer to the US on the crucial peace negotiations, but the world must not stand idle while innocent people are treated cruelly."
"It is time for strong voices in Europe, the US, Israel, and elsewhere to speak out and condemn this human rights tragedy among the Palestinian people."
A Hundred Years of Superconductivity
CHICAGO – The world’s first “quantum” computer – a machine that harnesses the magic of quantum phenomena to perform memory and processing tasks incredibly faster than today’s silicon-based computer chips – was recently sold by D-Wave Systems of Canada to Lockheed-Martin.
"And, while some question whether the machine is truly a quantum computer, its designers have published articles in peer-reviewed journals demonstrating that the basic elements of this novel computer are indeed superconducting quantum bits."
This spring marked the 100th anniversary of the discovery of superconductivity – the ability of materials to carry electrical current with no loss.
Currents set up in superconducting wires can exist for years without any measurable decay.
"Because of this property, superconductors have unique features that can be exploited in many ways."
"They can carry enormous amounts of current, making them ideal for urban power grids."
"And, when wound into coils, they can produce extremely strong magnetic fields."
Such superconducting magnets have been applied in a variety of technologies.
The best-known examples are the magnets that drive the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines found in most hospitals.
"Perhaps the most exotic are the huge magnets used to accelerate particles in the Large Hadron Collider, which seeks to discover the fundamental principles of matter."
"Despite their great promise, however, superconductors have limits, the primary one being that most superconduct at very low temperatures – indeed, near absolute zero (-273 ºC)."
Such temperatures can be achieved only through liquid-helium cooling.
"Thus, Swiss researchers caused excitement in 1986 by announcing the discovery of superconductivity in an oxide of copper at twice the temperature of the previous record holder."
"Shortly thereafter, researchers in the United States found a related material that superconducts above the temperature at which air liquefies."
"As Time magazine proclaimed in May 1987, with the discovery of these so-called “cuprates,” the superconducting revolution had begun."
"Alas, the revolution soon bogged down."
"Cuprates are notoriously difficult materials to work with, because they are very brittle."
This is exacerbated by their strong anisotropy – the materials have a quasi-two-dimensional structure consisting of a weakly coupled stack of conducting sheets.
"As such, they are a challenge for industry, though applications are beginning to appear."
"Since the cuprates first appeared, a variety of other “high temperature” superconductors have been discovered – one is a simple compound of magnesium and boron, and another involves a mixture of iron and arsenic."
"Although none of them superconduct at temperatures as high as liquid air, they may ultimately be better materials with which to work."
"Given the vast number of combinations of elements that can form compounds, there is a good chance that better superconductors await our discovery."
"In the coming years, superconductors are expected to play a growing role in technology."
"Already, “second generation” cuprate wires are being used to make high-capacity cables for electric-power transmission, and lighter-weight generators for wind turbines."
Stronger superconducting magnets are leading to the development of MRIs with more sophisticated diagnostic capabilities.
"Superconductors are being used for levitated trains in high-speed rail transport, and as microwave filters for improved signal bandwidth in cellular base stations."
The discovery of a new superconductor with enhanced properties could lead to even greater technological innovation.
This brings us to the intellectual challenge of superconductors.
"It took 46 years from the discovery of superconductivity to the 1957 Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS) theory of how the phenomenon occurs."
"Along the way, a number of famous physicists tried and failed to get the answer – Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg, and Richard Feynman being notable examples."
Discovering the solution required the development of advanced theoretical techniques.
What had been difficult to figure out was how to get electrons to superconduct.
"The basic discovery of BCS was that if the electrons pair up, those couples could indeed superconduct."
"Fortunately, the mechanism for such coupling was known."
"Although electrons are negatively charged, and therefore repel one another, the positive ions that they leave behind when they flow through a metal can mediate an effective attraction between two electrons under restrictive conditions (for example, the metal must be very cold)."
"The suspicion, though, is that this is not the case in the new superconductors."
"Cuprates superconduct at much higher temperatures, but, more importantly, they possess some exotic properties: they are formed by doping electrical carriers into a host material that is a magnetic insulator – the last place one would look for a conventional superconductor."
"And, unlike BCS theory, in which the pairs are isotropic – with identical properties in all directions in space – the pairs in cuprates are strongly anisotropic, resembling a cloverleaf."
"How can one pair electrons without ions holding them together, thereby enabling higher-temperature superconductors?"
"While ideas about this abound, new theoretical breakthroughs most likely will be needed to develop the machinery required to solve such electron-electron theories, perhaps even involving black holes."
"Whatever the theory turns out to be, it is certain to revolutionize physics."
Aid Work
NEW YORK – The critics of foreign aid are wrong.
"A growing flood of data shows that death rates in many poor countries are falling sharply, and that aid-supported programs for health-care delivery have played a key role."
Aid works; it saves lives.
"One of the newest studies, by Gabriel Demombynes and Sofia Trommlerova, shows that Kenya’s infant mortality (deaths under the age of one year) has plummeted in recent years, and attributes a significant part of the gain to the massive uptake of anti-malaria bed nets."
"These findings are consistent with an important study of malaria death rates by Chris Murray and others, which similarly found a significant and rapid decline in malaria-caused deaths after 2004 in sub-Saharan Africa resulting from aid-supported malaria-control measures."
Let’s turn back the clock a dozen years.
"In 2000, Africa was struggling with three major epidemics."
"AIDS was killing more than two million people each year, and spreading rapidly."
"Malaria was surging, owing to the parasite’s growing resistance to the standard medicine at the time."
"Tuberculosis was also soaring, partly as a result of the AIDS epidemic and partly because of the emergence of drug-resistant TB."
"In addition, hundreds of thousands of women were dying in childbirth each year, because they had no access to safe deliveries in a clinic or hospital, or to emergency help when needed."
These interconnected crises prompted action.
The United Nations’ member states adopted the Millennium Development Goals in September 2000.
"Three of the eight MDGs – reductions in children’s deaths, maternal deaths, and epidemic diseases – focus directly on health."
"Likewise, the World Health Organization issued a major call to scale up development assistance for health."
"And African leaders, led by Nigeria’s president at the time, Olusegun Obasanjo, took on the challenge of battling the continent’s epidemics."
"Nigeria hosted two landmark summits, on malaria in 2000 and on AIDS in 2001, which were a crucial spur to action."
"At the second of these summits, then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for the creation of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria."
"The Global Fund began operations in 2002, financing prevention, treatment, and care programs for the three diseases."
"High-income countries also finally agreed to reduce the debt owed by heavily indebted poor countries, allowing them to spend more on health care and less on crippling payments to creditors."
"The United States also took action, adopting two major programs, one to fight AIDS and the other to fight malaria."
"In 2005, the UN Millennium Project recommended specific ways to scale up primary health care in the poorest countries, with the high-income countries helping to cover the costs that the poorest could not pay by themselves."
"The UN General Assembly backed many of the project’s recommendations, which were then implemented in numerous low-income countries."
Donor aid did start to rise sharply as a result of all of these efforts.
"In 1995, total aid for health care was around $7.9 billion."
"This inadequate level then crept up slowly, to $10.5 billion by 2000."
"By 2005, however, annual aid for health had jumped another $5.9 billion, and by 2010, the total had grown by another $10.5 billion, to reach $26.9 billion for the year."
"The expanded funding allowed major campaigns against AIDS, TB, and malaria; a major scaling up of safe childbirth; and increased vaccine coverage, including the near-eradication of polio."
Many innovative public-health techniques were developed and adopted.
"With one billion people living in high-income countries, total aid in 2010 amounted to around $27 per person in the donor countries – a modest sum for them, but a life-saving one for the world’s poorest people."
The public-health successes can now be seen on many fronts.
Around 12 million children under five years old died in 1990.
"By 2010, this number had declined to around 7.6 million – still far too high, but definitely an historic improvement."
"Malaria deaths in children in Africa were cut from a peak of around one million in 2004 to around 700,000 by 2010, and, worldwide, deaths of pregnant women declined by almost half between 1990 and 2010, from an estimated 543,000 to 287,000."
"Another $10-15 billion in annual aid (that is, roughly $10-15 more per person in the high-income world), bringing total aid to around $40 billion per year, would enable still greater progress to be made in the coming years."
The MDGs for health could be achieved even in many of the world’s poorest countries.
"Unfortunately, at every step during the past decade – and still today – a chorus of aid skeptics has argued against the needed help."
"They have repeatedly claimed that aid does not work; that the funds will simply be wasted; that anti-malaria bed nets cannot be given to the poor, since the poor won’t use them; that the poor will not take anti-AIDS medicines properly; and so on and so forth."
Their attacks have been relentless (I’ve faced my share).
The opponents of aid are not merely wrong.
"Their vocal antagonism still threatens the funding that is needed to get the job done, to cut child and maternal deaths by enough to meet the MDGs by 2015 in the poorest countries, and to continue after that to ensure that all people everywhere finally have access to basic health services."
A decade of significant progress in health outcomes has proved the skeptics wrong.
Aid for health care works – and works magnificently – to save and improve lives.
"Let us continue to support these life-saving programs, which uphold the dignity and well-being of all people on the planet."
AIPAC in Decline
MADRID – The American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s lobbying power in the United States is undeniable.
"But AIPAC’s supposed ability to control US policy decisions is a Potemkin village myth, cultivated by friends and rivals alike."
"In fact, thanks to Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, AIPAC’s influence is under threat – though Netanyahu himself will be just fine."
Claims about AIPAC’s clout have long shaped analysis of US foreign policy.
"For example, Steve Walt and John Mearsheimer, in their notorious essay “The Israel Lobby,” asserted that AIPAC manufactured the Iraq War."
"But the reality is far less sinister: in that case, AIPAC merely surfed on the pro-invasion wave unleashed by President George W. Bush, with his Messianic urges, and Vice President Dick Cheney, a one-man war lobby."
"The truth about AIPAC – that it is influential, but far from invulnerable – has recently been revealed, both to the public and to the group itself."
"Having been pushed by Netanyahu into an unwinnable fight against US President Barack Obama’s administration over its nuclear deal with Iran, AIPAC is now crumbling under the weight of its own hubris."
"In fact, AIPAC has never overcome resolute opposition from an American president, particularly in a matter of US national security."
"It failed to stop Jimmy Carter from selling F-15 Eagle fighters to Saudi Arabia in 1978, or to prevent Ronald Reagan from supplying AWACS reconnaissance planes to the Saudis three years later."
And its 1991 battle with President George H.W. Bush over the linkage of US loan guarantees for Israel with Prime Minister Yitzak Shamir’s support of the 1991 Madrid peace conference – one of Bush’s key legacies – ended in defeat.
"Against this background, AIPAC should have known that its attempt, in close cooperation with Obama’s Republican opponents, to block the Iran nuclear deal (one of Obama’s most important achievements) would fail."
"Indeed, Obama even used a tactic similar to that of George H.W. Bush to win the day."
"Just as Bush openly denounced the “thousand lobbyists” working the halls of the US Congress against a vital national interest, Obama said in a conference call that his critics “would be opposed to any deal with Iran,” and called out AIPAC’s $20 million advertising campaign against the agreement."
He also put AIPAC in the same category as the Republicans who “were responsible” for leading the US into the Iraq war.
For AIPAC – which has traditionally relied on a broad coalition of social and political forces in the US that view Israel’s security as both a moral cause and a vital national interest – this is not any old defeat.
"The Republican-backed crusade against a key agreement negotiated by a Democratic president, with his party’s overwhelming support, has threatened the bipartisan foundations of Israel’s cause in America."
"Of course, the nuclear deal involved more than just the US and Iran."
"AIPAC was opposing an international agreement that six major world powers – China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the US – had already signed and that the United Nations had approved."
"Even some of Israel’s staunchest supporters in Congress were unlikely to deal a potentially devastating blow to America’s international credibility, and the idea that the negotiating countries would all agree to reopen the talks to produce a “better deal” was sheer fantasy."
Yet that is the objective that Netanyahu set for AIPAC.
"The row over the Iran deal is bound to be a watershed moment for American Jews, among whom sharp divisions have formed."
"Indeed, the American Jewish Committee 2015 Survey of American Jewish Opinion reports the emergence of “two diverging Jewish sub-communities,” with a growing number of Jews feeling alienated by the organizations that claim to represent them."
AIPAC represents a striking anomaly in the life of American Jews.
"It is increasingly identified with the Republican agenda and Israel’s evangelical Christian supporters, even though polls have repeatedly shown that Jews are America’s most liberal ethnic group."
The truth is that American Jews largely opposed the Iraq war.
They overwhelmingly vote for the Democratic Party.
"They define their religion as moderate and liberal, with many upholding gay rights and abortion, both anathema to evangelical Christians."
The majority of American Jews even support the creation of a Palestinian state.
"And, although they are far from united on the Iran deal, the agreement’s supporters outnumber its opponents."
"Much of the blame for the damage that has been done – to AIPAC, American Jewish communities, and even the US political process – falls on Netanyahu."
But he is unlikely to face retribution for any of it.
"On the contrary, the Obama administration has already begun the discussions it promised on upgrading Israel’s strategic capabilities."
As Arab countries throughout the Middle East melt down – with increasingly significant spillover effects in the West – Israel continues to represent a stable regional partner for the US.
"More dangerous, Netanyahu could achieve his next goal: preventing a strategic détente between the US and Iran that would enable cooperation in resolving major regional conflicts, from Yemen to Syria."
"After all, Obama’s victory on the nuclear deal may have been inevitable, but it was far from easy."
"An odd coalition of Iranian radicals, AIPAC, the Saudi-led Sunni alliance, the Israeli government, and US politicians from both parties have already compelled Obama to promise additional sanctions on Iran for its sponsorship of terrorism."
"As a result, America’s cold war with Iran is likely to persist."
A Japanese Metamorphosis?
OSAKA – Yesterday’s landslide general-election victory by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) terminated the one-party-dominated system that the catch-all Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has controlled almost without interruption since 1955.
"For most of the last decade, the DPJ was not seen as a viable alternative to the LDP, although they appeared to form a pseudo-two-party system."
"Twenty years after the Cold War’s end, Japan will at last have a post-Cold War system of government."
"The Japanese public, even now, remains uncertain about the DPJ’s ability to govern and is skeptical of its rosy programs of wealth redistribution, which lack solid funding."
"The public is also fully aware that the ideologically fragmented DPJ lacks a pragmatic, coherent foreign and security policy"
Yet the DPJ will form the next government because of public disgust with the LDP.
"For the last four years, the LDP had shown itself to be utterly unresponsive to the key issues of popular concern: pensions, unemployment, and the fraying social safety net."
"Moreover, the LDP was plagued by a string of minor scandals and consistent bungling."
The LDP’s need for three different prime ministers in the space of little more than a year made plain that the party’s power nucleus had melted down.
"Once in power, the DPJ will immediately confront the massive bureaucracy and entrenched mandarins, which usually sabotage any efforts at administrative reform that threatens their power and vested interests."
"Indeed, immediately after the election, the budget estimates for the next fiscal year are due."
"The figures that will be presented are the result of a lengthy process, in which the bureaucracy closely consulted with LDP."
"So, without breaking the regular budget cycle, the DPJ will be forced to implement not only the supplementary budget drawn up by the LDP, but will also be stuck with next year’s budget, which embodies LDP policies that the DPJ has denounced."
"As a result, the DPJ has announced plans to revoke the LDP’s guidelines for a ceiling on budget requests so as to formulate its own budget from scratch. It will also revise the supplementary budget as well."
"But time is short, and few of new DPJ lawmakers possess the legislative experience and budgetary expertise to make that happen."
"To gain control of the mandarins, the DPJ plans to place 100 lawmakers in the ministries’ top leadership, as well as three dozen political appointees to policy staffs in the office of the prime minister."
"Unfortunately, the DPJ scrapped an LDP-sponsored civil-service reform bill, which would have allowed the DPJ to replace mandarins with an army of political appointees."
"The DPJ, despite its manifesto, seems unprepared to tame the mandarins, and so may be forced to rely on them."
The ascendency of the mandarins is a legacy of Japan’s unique historical development dating back to its early modern period.
"Unlike in Europe, Japan developed its state before building a strong civil society."
"Indeed, full-fledged “society”-building started only after the 1868 Meiji Restoration, which tipped the balance of power definitively in favor of the state."
"As a result, the mandarins survived WWII and the postwar American occupation relatively undamaged, and they will strive to survive the DPJ government as well."
They will most likely succeed.
"LDP lawmakers and mandarins developed a routine in which mandarins drafted cabinet-sponsored bills, LDP lawmakers checked the bills, and the two together finalized legislative drafts before they were introduced to the Diet (parliament)."
"Since the LDP, recently with a coalition partner, controlled the Diet, the legislative process was simply the interaction between LDP lawmakers and mandarins, centered in the LDP’s headquarters."
The Diet’s role was merely pro forma.
"Indeed, under the LDP-led one-party-dominant system, this extra-constitutional mechanism became an integral part of Japan’s government polity."
"The DPJ government will collide head-on with the mandarins, partly because the party will find it hard to recruit sufficiently qualified policymakers."
"The mandarins have maintained their privileged position in this regard, owing partly to the tax system, which prevents the emergence of non-profit institutions, especially think tanks, where independent policy expertise can be forged."
"Moreover, perhaps in anticipation of a change in power, the mandarins have moved forward the annual personnel changes in the major ministries’ top administrative positions."
And what of the LDP?
"Having fallen from power, it will lose its control of the redistribution of government funds."
"Unable to pay off its constituencies, disintegration looms, for the LDP has never been a party with entrenched grass-roots support, but instead operates as a machine of power and redistribution through a web of insiders across the country’s industrial sectors, occupational associations, and local communities."
Only by recruiting new blood and reorganizing itself with a solid ideological platform will an LDP comeback be possible.
"The DPJ has even weaker grass-roots support, so the mandarins will most likely use their standard techniques of divide and rule to cajole the party by teaching it to mimic the LDP in using state money and contracts to underwrite its major constituencies, such as labor unions and other interest groups."
The birth of the DPJ government can yet be a turning point.
A major power shift in favor of “society” has taken place.
"If the DPJ can break free of mandarin control by centralizing policy formation in the office of the prime minister, as it intends, Japan can emerge as a more resilient democracy with a full-fledged two-party system and greater willingness to assume an international leadership role."
A Jobless Recovery?
CAMBRIDGE – Who will suffer the longest and the most from the implosion in 2008-2009 of Wall Street and the ensuing world recession?
Not the bankers and financiers who created the disaster.
"Some financiers, like Bernard Madoff, will go to prison for fraud."
"But, although Madoff was only the tip of the iceberg of rampant financial malfeasance, most suspect financiers need not fear arrest, either because their behavior merely skirted the law, or because financial impropriety more subtle than outright fraud is often difficult to prove."
"Some bank bosses will retire in shame, but with huge payments to ease their pain – such as the $55 million golden parachute handed to Bank of America’s Ken Lewis, with his, and the £25 million pension bestowed on Royal Bank of Scotland’s Fred Godwin."
"But, buoyed by government bailout money, guarantees, and low interest rates, many banks have again begun to pay their top managers huge bonuses while fighting vigorously against reforms designed to restrain their risk-taking and compensation."
The big losers from this economic disaster are workers in the advanced countries that bought into the laissez-faire flexibility of American-style capitalism.
"From 2007 to October 2009, the United States lost nearly eight million jobs, which reduced the employment-population ratio from 63% to 58.5%."
"The unemployment rate at the end of 2009 was above 10%, duration of joblessness was the longest since the Great Depression, millions had had their working hours cut, and millions more were too discouraged by a lack of jobs to seek work."
"Advanced Europe, Canada, and Japan also suffered major job losses that will last for a long time."
"Spain, which allows for widespread temporary contracts, has had the biggest increase in unemployment, because Spanish workers can be fired as quickly as those in the US."
"Some countries – for example, Germany, Sweden, and South Korea – have “hidden” their joblessness by paying firms to keep workers on the payroll."
"This can work in the short term, but it cannot be sustained over time."
"From the 1980’s through the mid-2000’s, employment has increasingly lagged GDP in economic recoveries."
"In the US, there was a jobless recovery under President Bill Clinton until the dot.com boom in the latter part of the 1990’s, and there was a jobless recovery under George W. Bush in the wake of the 2001 slowdown."
"In the early 1990’s, Sweden suffered a huge recession precipitated by a housing bubble and a banking crisis."
"Its unemployment rate rose from 1.8% in 1990 to 9.6% in 1994, before bottoming out at 5% in 2001."
"Sixteen years after the crisis, the unemployment rate was 6.2% – more than triple the rate in 1990."
"In 1997, Korea suffered not only from the Asian financial crisis, but also from insistence by the US and the International Monetary Fund that it raise interest rates and undertake “Washington Consensus”-style reforms to receive aid."
"Employment recovered, but primarily in “non-regular” jobs with limited benefits, low wages, and little job security."
Inequality in Korea rose from moderate levels to second highest (behind the US) among advanced OECD countries.
Weakness in the job market takes a huge toll on economic and personal well-being.
Young people seeking their first jobs and experienced workers who lose jobs in a weak job market suffer economic losses that will last their entire lives.
Studies of happiness show that unemployment reduces happiness by as much as the loss of a family member.
It is difficult to see the US re-attaining full employment anytime soon.
"From 1993 to 1998, the US created millions of jobs, which raised the employment rate by 5.4 percentage points."
"If employment began rising at this rate in 2010, it would take until 2015 before it reached its pre-recession level."
"And slow recovery in the US will drag down recovery in other advanced countries, reducing their employment as well."
"A long, painful period of high unemployment runs counter to what most experts believed the flexible US economic model would ever produce."
"From the early 1990’s on, many analysts viewed America’s weak unionization, at-will employment, limited legal job protection, and high job turnover as major factors in achieving a lower unemployment rate than most EU countries."
Many OECD countries initiated various kinds of flexibility reforms in the hope of improving their economies along US lines.
The view that flexibility is the key factor in employment is no longer tenable.
"In its 2009 Employment Outlook , the OECD took a hard look at its favored policy reforms and found them deficient in helping countries adjust to a finance-driven recession."
"According to the OECD, “there does not appear to be any strong reason to expect that recent structural reforms mean that OECD labor markets are now substantially less sensitive to severe economic downturns.”"
So the lesson from the recession is clear.
"The weak reed in capitalism is not the labor market, but the financial market."
"At worst, labor-market failures impose modest inefficiency costs on society, whereas capital-market failures harm society greatly, with workers, rather than the perpetrators of financial disaster, suffering the most."
"Moreover, globalization means that the US capital market’s failure spreads misery around the world."
"We owe it to workers victimized by this recession to reinvent finance so that it works to enrich the real economy, instead of enriching only the financiers."
This means changing the incentives and rules that govern the financial sector.
"Since other countries’ economies and jobs are also at stake, they owe it to their citizens to press the US to deliver meaningful financial reforms."
A Kick-Off for Peace?
Yerevan – Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan’s recent invitation to Turkish President Abdullah Gul to visit Yerevan to watch a football match together was historic.
"Given the two countries’ long-strained relations, this visit would have been remarkable at any time. But coming as it does only one month after the alarming Russian-Georgian confrontation, it may offer real hope that tensions in the volatile Caucasus region can be eased."
"Of course, ancient and difficult issues divide Armenia and Turkey. But now is the moment for both countries to put the past aside in order to address their common security concerns."
"In the new context set by the war in Georgia, the urgency of Turkey becoming a real bridge between the nations of the Caucasus is not lost on anyone."
This expectation is an inevitable consequence of Turkey’s geography and history.
"Situated figuratively between modernity and tradition, secularism and Islam, and democracy and tyranny, Turkey also is an actual physical bridge between East and West."
"For the peoples of the Caucasus, Turkey marks our path to Europe."
"It is a NATO member, bordering the three Caucasus republics that have NATO Individual Partnership Action Programs."
"It aspires to join the European Union, and would bring the EU to our three borders, even as we, too, aspire to join one day."
"Indeed, Turkey has never missed an opportunity to present itself as a regional broker."
"Immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Turkey proposed the Black Sea Economic Cooperation."
"This year, as the American-led effort to mediate a Middle East peace settlement began to falter, Turkey took up the job of mediator in both the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the conflict between Syria and Israel."
"Now, in the immediate wake of the Russia-Georgia crisis, Turkey’s leaders have stepped forward once again to take a leadership role in the Caucasus."
The world must fervently hope that the Turkish proposal for a Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform is more serious and sustained than previous similar efforts.
"But, in order to succeed, Turkey must firmly pursue a pledge from all the region’s players to repudiate the use of force in settling their disputes."
"If this pledge is adopted and respected, conflicts in the region will be viewed in a wholly different, more tolerant context, marking a historic breakthrough to peace."
"In fact, why not take the idea of such a pact one step further?"
"We in this region can, and I believe should, call for a non-aligned Caucasus, free of security blocs and adversarial alliances."
"After all, security alliances and guarantees only create dividing lines, with their attendant security challenges."
"Our countries and peoples have, throughout history, lived under a common umbrella for far longer than we have been divided."
"Today, we share a common vision of European integration, and it is in this broader context that our conflicts should be resolved."
French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s and German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s visits to Georgia and Russia proved that there is no substitute for Europe insofar as the Caucasus is concerned.
Only Europe can play the role of honest broker in the region’s atmosphere of suspicion and intolerance.
"But, at the end of the day, we ourselves must be willing to work toward a region of peace and cooperation."
The Caucasus is too small a space for closed borders and explosive conflicts.
"Although some of those tensions appear purely bilateral, the Georgian-Russian conflict demonstrates that there is no such thing anymore in this globalized world, and certainly not in this interconnected region."
"In fact, real peace in the Caucasus requires two key strategic transformations."
One is a lesson from history: Russia’s strategic interests here cannot be ignored.
To believe and behave otherwise would lead to regional chaos.
The other lesson is that Turkey and Armenia cannot remain adversaries forever.
There must be normalization in our relations in order for the Caucasus to coalesce into a functional region.
"Ironically, both Russia and the United States recognize that this is in their interest."
The Russians view normal relations between Turkey and Armenia as a way to minimize Georgia’s strategic role in the region.
The US views an opening to Turkey as a way to decrease Armenia’s real and imagined reliance on Russia.
"Beyond the emotional impact of President Gul’s visit to Yerevan, real improvement in Turkish-Armenian relations requires opening the two countries’ closed border – the last in Europe."
"Or, for a start, the existing railroad link between the two countries could be made operational."
"If this does not happen within the coming weeks and months, then Turkey will have demonstrated that all this was just a show."
"President Gul’s visit does mark a watershed – either as a failure to make history, or as the beginning of a new era."
Alan Greenspan on Trial
The release of Alan Greenspan’s ghostwritten memoirs The Age of Turbulence has elicited charges that he was not such a great central banker after all.
"Stan Collender of National Journal sees the fingerprints of the White House on these attacks: Greenspan is harshly critical of George W. Bush’s administration, after all, and to attack the credibility of Republican ex-policymakers who are critical of Bush is standard counterpunching for it."
But what is one to make of the criticisms of Greenspan’s tenure at the Federal Reserve?
"The indictment contains four counts: that Greenspan wrongly cheered the growth of non-standard adjustable-rate mortgages, which fueled the housing bubble; that he wrongly endorsed Bush’s tax cuts; that he should have reined in the stock market bubble of the 1990’s; and that he should have done the same with the real estate bubble of the 2000’s."
"To the first two counts, Greenspan now pleads guilty."
He says that he did not understand how the growth of non-standard mortgages had lured borrowers and investors into bearing dangerous risks.
"He was, he now says, focusing on how fixed-rate mortgages are relatively bad deals for borrowers in times of low inflation, which was a mistake."
Greenspan also pleads guilty to a mistake in early 2001.
He thought that he was giving balanced testimony to Congress on government budget issues.
"He testified that it is important to run surpluses to pay down the debt, but that surpluses must not be so large that the government winds up owning American industry."
"He also testified that tax cuts are better than spending increases to keep surpluses from growing too large, but that uncertainty is enormous, so that any tax cuts should be canceled if they threatened to bring us back to an age of deficits."
"Robert Rubin and Kent Conrad warned him that the press would not interpret his testimony as being balanced, and that Congress would interpret it as an excuse to abandon fiscal discipline."
They were right.
Greenspan also pleads guilty to misunderstanding the character of the Bush administration.
He thought that his old reality-based friends from the Ford administration were back in power.
He thought that he – and Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill – could win the quiet “inside game” for sensible policy without resorting to an “outside game” that would make his reappointment in 2004 unlikely.
He was wrong.
But how serious are these policy-political crimes to which Greenspan now pleads guilty?
"In my view, they are misdemeanors."
Against them you have to set what former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers calls Greenspan’s “golden glove” performance at avoiding and minimizing recessions during his years at the Fed.
"The “felonies” of which Greenspan stands accused are the other two charges: that he should have done more to stop the stock market bubble of the late 1990’s, and that he should have done more to stop the housing bubble of the early 2000’s."
"Here, Greenspan holds his ground, and pleads not guilty."
"The only way, he says, for the Fed to have kept stock prices in reasonable equilibrium ranges in the late 1990’s would have been to raise interest rates so high that they hit the real economy on the head with a brick."
"Interest rates high enough to curb stock market speculation would also have curbed construction and other forms of investment, raised unemployment, and sent the economy into recession."
"To cause a significant current evil in order to avoid a possible future danger when our knowledge is limited and our judgments uncertain is, Greenspan believes, unwise."
"In this, he is following a tradition of caution that extends from Edmund Burke to John Maynard Keynes."
Greenspan mounts a similar defense concerning the housing bubble.
High construction employment has been good for American workers in the past half-decade – a period that has not produced much good for them.
"Higher interest rates to reduce the housing boom seem, even in retrospect, ill advised if the cost is mass unemployment."
And Greenspan eschews paternalism: he would not assume the role of a regulator telling people that they cannot buy a house even though a lender is willing to finance it.
But Greenspan would have served the country and the world better if he had been somewhat more paternalist in slowing the growth of non-standard adjustable-rate mortgages.
"He would have served the country and the world better had he been less of a loyal Republican working the inside game of trying to convince Bush’s political advisors that good policy was important, and more of a nonpartisan steward of America’s long-term fiscal stability."
"Of course, such a Greenspan would never have been re-appointed."
"All in all, Greenspan served the United States and the world well through his stewardship of monetary policy, especially by what he did not do: trying to stop stock and housing speculation by halting the economy in its tracks."
A Lasting Poison
NEW YORK – Next year will mark the twentieth anniversary of the collapse of communism in Europe.
"Liberated from the complexity of knowing too much about the cruel past, the young people of Eastern Europe’s post-communist generation seem uninterested in what their parents and grandparents endured."
Yet the recent revelation of the Czech writer Milan Kundera’s presumed complicity in the face of Stalinism is but the latest of the long half-life of a toxic past.
"Other examples come to mind: the accusations of collaboration with the secret police raised against Lech Walesa, Romania’s public controversies surrounding Mircea Eliade’s fascist past, and the attacks on the alleged “Jewish monopoly of suffering” which equate the Holocaust with the Soviet Gulag."
"Friedrich Nietzsche said that if you look in the eye of the Devil for too long, you risk becoming a devil yourself."
"A Bolshevik anticommunism, similar in its dogmatism to communism itself, has from time to time run riot in parts of Eastern Europe."
"In country after country, that Manichean mindset, with its oversimplifications and manipulations, was merely re-fashioned to serve the new people in power."
"Opportunism has had its share in this, of course."
"In 1945, when the Red Army occupied Romania, the Communist Party had no more than 1,000 members; in 1989, it had almost four million."
"One day after Nicolae Ceausescu’s execution, most of these people suddenly became fierce anticommunists and victims of the system they had served for decades."
"Residual traces of totalitarian thinking can also be found in the hostility to former dissidents like Adam Michnik or Václav Havel, both of whom argued that the new democracies should not exploit resentments or seek revenge, as the totalitarian state did, but instead build a new national consensus to structure and empower a genuine civil society."
Former generals of the secret police and members of the Communist
But the case of Kundera appears different – though no less disturbing.
"In 1950, Kundera, then a 20-year-old Communist, reportedly denounced to the criminal police as a Western spy a man he had never met – a friend of his friend’s girlfriend."
The man was later brutally interrogated in a former Gestapo torture facility and spent 14 years in prison.
"Kundera’s name was contained in the investigating officer’s report, which was authenticated after a respected historian discovered it in a dusty Prague archive."
"The reclusive Kundera, who immigrated to Paris in 1975, has declared that “it never happened.”"
"Moreover, Czechoslovakia’s fearsome secret police, who had every interest in silencing or compromising the famous dissident writer, never used the incident to blackmail or expose him."
"Until more information is forthcoming, both from Kundera and from the authorities, the case will not be solved “beyond reasonable doubt.” But"
"As far as we know, Kundera never was an informer before or after this incident, and we cannot ignore that he later freed himself from the compulsory totalitarian happiness that communism propagated."
"Indeed, his case also serves as a reminder that the early 1950’s was the most brutal period of “proletarian dictatorship” in Eastern Europe – a period of great enthusiasm and terrible fear that poisoned the minds and souls of devoted believers, fierce opponents, and apathetic bystanders alike."
"Moreover, Kundera’s case is hardly unique."
"In 2006, the Nobel Prize-winning German author Günter Grass’s disclosed that, 60 years earlier, he was, as a teenager, a member of the Waffen-SS."
"Similarly, a few years ago, the world was shocked to learn that famous Italian writer Ignazio Silone had, in his youth, collaborated with the fascist police."
"Daily life under totalitarianism, be it communist or fascist, was routinely based on a deep duplicity whose effects are longstanding."
I don’t agree with those who say we should not be interested in the dark episodes in the life of a great writer.
Why not?
"We should be interested not for prosecutorial purposes, but in order to gain a more profound understanding of a bloody, demagogical, and tyrannical Utopia – and of human weakness and vulnerability. We may even consider it a rewarding testament to an artist’s ability to overcome his past mistakes and still produce priceless work."
"But can we justifiably defend morally compromised artists and intellectuals on the basis of their work’s merit, yet condemn ordinary people for often less grave offenses?"
"An egregious example of this was the way followers of Romanian philosopher Constantin Noica defended his support for the fascist Iron Guard and his later collaboration with the Communists, while at the same time condemning even a generic cleaning woman for mopping the floors in the offices of the secret police."
"Shouldn’t that cleaner’s drudgery to support her family, children, and her own survival be taken equally into account?"
"Life under totalitarianism was an extreme situation that requires us to apply special, nuanced rules to"
"In Eastern Europe today, old and young alike stand to benefit from that lesson."
"Moses wandered with his people in the desert for 40 years, until they had rid themselves of the poisonous slave mentality."
Leaders for a Leaderless World
PARIS – The newspaper commentaries that I write often have a dark perspective.
"Sadly, this one will be no different. But there are two pieces of good news that break through the gloom."
"First, the global significance of US President Barack Obama’s reelection is clear: the world has escaped a disaster for international cooperation."
"The US was on the verge of sinking into isolationist nationalism, reinforced, perhaps, by xenophobic sentiment."
"Obama’s victory, despite America’s economic travails, clears the way for cooperation based on a sympathetic ear to others and on negotiations in which the US does not deny the legitimacy of a global public interest (as it has done, unfortunately, on the issue of climate change)."
"The other piece of good news concerns France, and thus is more “local,” but is crucially important nonetheless."
"Like everywhere else in the developed world, the global crisis has hit the French economy hard, with output stagnating, unemployment rising, job insecurity mounting, government debt soaring, and the stock market at risk of crashing."
"Manufacturing production has plummeted, the trade balance has deteriorated sharply, and corporate bankruptcies are increasingly frequent."
"For six months, France has had new leadership – a new president, government, and parliament. But President François Hollande and his government were strangely inactive after the elections, limiting themselves to reducing the impact of unfair budget cuts and taxation reforms implemented by the previous government of Nicolas Sarkozy."
Many began to wonder whether Hollande was aware of the scope of the crisis that the recent downturn might trigger.
"In recent weeks, however, the government has introduced energetic and courageous measures to boost the competitiveness of French industries, including a huge €20 billion ($26 billion) tax break for businesses, to be financed by a hike in value-added tax, which means that the general public will pay for it."
"The VAT increase will hurt, but there was no other way."
"Awareness, boldness, and comprehensive policymaking have come as a relief to French investors, and have left them better positioned to face the crisis."
"The French government’s new push to confront the country’s economic plight matters not only to France, but to Europe and the world as well."
"After all, France is the eurozone’s second-largest economy, and the fifth-largest economy in the world."
"And yet, despite these bright spots, international cooperation on issues ranging from regional conflicts to the protection of global public goods remains weak."
"Antarctica, the only land in the world that is administered directly by the international community, is a recent case in point."
"The Antarctic Treaty, negotiated in 1959, prohibits any and all military activities in Antarctica and forbids the establishment of any borders."
"Three agreements – the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972), the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR, 1980), and the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (PEP, 1991), which prohibits any activity relating to mineral resources – have since been added to the treaty."
"The Antarctic Treaty System includes three annual meetings: one deals with the supervision and management of the Treaty itself, and the other two concern the CCAMLR and the PEP."
"In recent years, proposals have been considered that would establish marine reserves around the continent and end the risk of growing scarcity, or the outright disappearance, of a variety of species of fish and cetaceans."
"The principle that international cooperation is required to protect fishery resources, which are dwindling everywhere, was adopted at the 2011 CCAMLR meeting."
"At the 2012 CCAMLR meeting, which concluded at the beginning of November in Hobart, Australia, three proposals (from the US, New Zealand, and France/Australia) to establish marine reserves in three different areas were discussed."
They were compatible and would reinforce one another.
"Yet the discussion foundered, and no decision was taken."
"Russia and Ukraine – and, to a lesser extent, China – blocked efforts to reach an agreement."
"This failure reflects the same dynamic at work in the breakdown of global climate-change conferences in recent years: a few cynical countries, whose cooperation is needed to save the planet, fuel the madness of those bent on destroying it."
That will not change until a new consciousness emerges worldwide to persuade states to support binding international law.
The US has now reelected a president who understands this.
"France has a president who understands the need for bold, far-reaching actions as well."
"Their active leadership, and that of others, is needed now more than ever to turn the tide."
A League of Democracies?
"LONDON – Senator John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate, has been calling for the creation of a “League of Democracies.”"
"This new international group would possess a formidable military capacity, based partly on NATO and partly on a “new quadrilateral security partnership” in the Pacific between Australia, India, Japan, and the US. Neither Russia nor China, of course, would be invited to join: indeed, McCain wants to exclude Russia from the G8."
"The League is necessary, argues McCain, because in matters vital to the US, such as fighting Islamic terrorism, humanitarian intervention, and spreading liberty, democracy, and free markets, the US and its democratic partners must be able to act without permission from the United Nations (i.e., from Russia and China)."
"In other words, the League’s main purpose is to marginalize Russia and China in world affairs."
The most damning criticism of McCain’s plan is that it would launch a new Cold War between states labeled democracies and autocracies.
"This is not only dangerous, but incoherent."
"Russia and China do not “threaten” the “free world” with a powerful ideology and massive armed forces, as they did during the Cold War."
"Moreover, the world’s democracies are themselves divided on how to deal with Islamic terrorism or genocide in Darfur: it was France, after all, which led the opposition in the UN Security Council to the US invasion of Iraq."
"Moreover, on issues like terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and climate change, the US needs Russian and Chinese help."
Stigmatizing Russia and China as pariahs will not get them on board.
"(China must learn to behave “responsibly,” McCain declares with breath-taking condescension.) In fact, Russia has mostly cooperated with the US in the “war against terrorism.”"
"Finally, the idea is impracticable."
One cannot imagine India or Brazil wanting to be part of any such a combination.
So we would all spare ourselves an awful lot of trouble if McCain’s brainchild were buried as quickly as possible.
"Yet underlying this idea is a serious proposition, to which Britain’s former prime minister, Tony Blair, often gave eloquent expression: democracies don’t fight each other, so if the whole world were democratic, wars would stop."
"Presumably, McCain’s League of Democracies is designed to bring Immanuel Kant’s dream of perpetual peace closer to realization by putting  pressure on non-democracies to change their ways, by force if necessary."
Leave aside the fact that efforts to make democracy bloom have become bloodily unstuck in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Is it true that democracies never fight each other?
The affirmative answer seems to depend on two separate claims.
"The first is that democracies have, as a matter of historical record, never fought each other."
"This is true of a rather small group of rich countries (India is a partial exception), mainly in western Europe and its overseas offshoots, since World War II."
"Moroever, they are “our kind” of democracy – constitutional democracies that contain all the features we take for granted in modern Western systems, not “Islamic democracies” like Iran."
A reasonable generalization from this rather small sample would be that “prosperous and constitutional democracies tend to live in peace with each other.”
The second claim is that these countries live in peace because they are democracies.
"But is it democracy that has brought them peace and prosperity, or is it peace and prosperity that have brought democracy?"
"Is it democracy that has kept Europe peaceful since 1945, or is it the long period of peace since 1945 that has allowed democracy to become the European norm?"
The world already has a peace-maintaining institution.
The UN was created under rules designed to enable states of different political colors to live together.
Members accept the obligation not to use force except in self-defense or unless it is authorized by the Security Council.
"The US is frustrated by not being able to get its way at the UN. But the UN exists to protect all states from lawless behavior, including by the US."
"By implicitly bypassing the UN, and dividing the world into two armed camps, the League of Democracies would increase the danger of war."
The world also already has a prosperity-spreading mechanism.
It is called trade.
"In 1994, the World Trade Organization was created to liberalize trade under agreed rules."
"It is full of faults, which need to be corrected. But we don’t need a League of Democracies to do this."
"By subjecting trade relations to embargoes, sanctions, and tests of democracy, environmental standards, and human rights, the League is likely to retard the growth of trade, and thus the chance for poor non-democracies to catch up."
The only purpose of the League of Democracies seems to be to legitimize war-making by democracies – in order to spread democracy!
This is the thrust of McCain’s message.
"As he put it, the US was built for a purpose – to serve “eternal and universal principles.”"
"Its God-given task is to build an “enduring global peace on the foundations of freedom, security, prosperity, and hope.”"
Noble rhetoric!
But if that is the League’s purpose – and I see no other – then it is a danger to peace. This is because its advocates believe that no long-term co-existence with non-democracies is possible.
This is crazy and unhistorical.
"It is up to the chastened nations of Western Europe, which broadly share American values but have learned something about political patience, to rein in the American fantasy of re-making the world in its own image."
"I am all for spreading Western-style democracy, but not at the cost of making the world more warlike."
"Peaceful coexistence between different political systems is an attainable objective, and one to which all the world’s major powers can sign up."
The Battle for Moscow
"PARIS – Today’s most important political battle in Russia is not for control of the Kremlin, but for power over its capital city."
"Indeed, the outcome of Moscow’s mayoral election campaign concerns every Russian – and everyone who is interested in Russia’s fate."
"Just as presidential elections in the United States matter for the entire world, mayoral elections in Moscow matter for Russia’s national politics – and thus for its economy."
"So what happens in Moscow on September 8 (and, possibly, in the run-off election two weeks later) will have profound implications for the country’s future."
The election is a watershed for several reasons.
"For starters, this is the first Moscow mayoral campaign since President Vladimir Putin canceled subnational elections in 2005."
"(Putin’s one-term successor, Dmitri Medvedev, now the prime minister, reinstated them in 2011.)"
"Since the last mayoral election in 2004, Moscow has changed dramatically."
"It is now not only the largest and most important subnational entity in the Russian Federation; it also is a major European capital, a global business destination, and a large consumer market."
Per capita income in Moscow is similar to that of Spain or Italy.
The size of Moscow’s city budget is close to that of New York City.
Officially 12 million people live in Moscow (not counting commuters and irregular immigrants) – more than in an average European country.
"And yet, before this year, Moscow’s mayor was appointed by the federal government, not elected by Muscovites."
"Second, the ongoing mayoral race is an unusually competitive election in Putin’s Russia."
The most important indication of this is the participation of Alexei Navalny – by far the Kremlin’s most persistent political opponent.
"Navalny was registered as a candidate in the election and joined the campaign a day after being released from jail, following his conviction – and five-year prison sentence – in a completely fabricated case."
Why the government first imprisoned him and then released him less than 24 hours later remains a mystery.
What is clear is that the authorities want the Moscow mayoral election to be substantially more competitive than anyone expected it to be.
"Third, thanks to Navalny’s participation, the Moscow election has fostered – for the first time ever – genuine grassroots politics in Russia."
"Denied access to TV, Navalny has launched a US-style door-to-door campaign."
"He has enlisted an unprecedented 15,000 volunteers (mostly young) and has raised – again unprecedented for Russia – $1.5 million dollars from 8,000 Russian citizens to finance his campaign."
Navalny’s volunteers not only promote his message through social media; they also distribute his program and talk to voters in Moscow’s streets and Metro.
"Most impressive (and completely unheard of in Russia), Navalny himself organizes three street rallies every weekday and five rallies on Saturdays and Sundays."
His goal is to hold a hundred such rallies by the end of the campaign.
"Finally, Navalny’s background and support base give him a level of moral authority with voters that other politicians in Putin’s Russia cannot attain."
"Navalny’s campaign is crowd-funded by ordinary Russians, who understand that he is not on the payroll of an oligarch or the government."
"Indeed, Navalny has been a persistent and effective critic of corruption in both the Russian government and state-owned companies."
"Moreover, even though his emails have been hacked and published, and the government has searched his home and confiscated his computers and phones, there are no convincing charges against him – except for the obviously politically motivated cases."
"As a result, voters can be confident that Navalny, who refused to bow to legal intimidation, is clean, and that he is running for the job not for his own material benefit or to do the bidding of any particular interest group, but because he believes in a greater good."
A campaign such as Navalny’s certainly bodes well for Russia’s future.
"Indeed, the absence of genuine political competition and the public’s lack of confidence in Russia’s politicians are the country’s main problems, for they undermine the rule of law, enable interest groups to “capture” state institutions, and encourage corruption, all of which have led to capital flight and a brain drain."
"Thus, Navalny’s growing support in Moscow is good news not only for Russian citizens, but also for those who invest in Russia."
"To be sure, there are still many reasons to be worried."
"Navalny certainly is not perfect, and, though the Moscow election may be competitive by Russian standards, it is still outrageously unfair in terms of media access, financing, and voter intimidation."
"Putin and the ruling party did not win a majority in Moscow in the 2011 Duma election or the 2012 presidential election, but they seem confident of victory in the city this time."
"And Navalny’s five-year prison sentence remains in place, pending an appeal whose outcome is completely uncertain."
"Even so, what we are witnessing in Moscow far exceeds anyone’s expectations."
"Win or lose, Navalny’s campaign will have a lasting impact."
A Liquid Europe
BRUSSELS – Is the eurozone stepping back from the brink?
"This might just be possible, because the emerging outlines of a new framework to resolve the ongoing sovereign-debt crisis contain a key component that was missing so far."
"Indeed, that component’s absence was behind this summer’s spreading financial crisis, which moved beyond small, peripheral countries like Greece, Ireland, and Portugal to strike systemically important countries like Italy and Spain."
"The starting point of the contagion was investors’ realization that Europe’s rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, was designed to provide emergency financial support only to the peripheral countries."
"It simply does not and will never have enough funds to undertake the massive bond purchases required to stabilize the debt markets of large economies such as Spain and Italy. The EFSF will have at most €440 billion at its disposal (any increase would endanger France’s AAA rating), while the combined public debt of Italy and Spain is more than €2 trillion."
"In early August, the domino effect of the eurozone periphery’s sovereign-debt crisis started to kick in, because financial markets do not wait for country after country to be downgraded."
"Instead, they tend to anticipate the endgame, or at least one potential scenario, namely the unraveling of the entire crisis-containment structure."
Markets noticed that the euro seemed caught between a rock (the EFSF’s limited borrowing capacity) and a hard place (the European Central Bank’s great reluctance to engage in large-scale purchases of financially troubled governments’ bonds).
"It later turned out that the ECB was not that hard after all, though it emphasized that it would stop intervening as soon as the new EFSF became operational."
"And, given the EFSF’s limited firepower, the market would have been left without support."
"To state the problem more generally, the eurozone requires a liquidity backstop for its fiscal authority."
"In a “normal” economy with its own currency, the fiscal authorities can never face a liquidity shortage, because the government can always rely, at least potentially, on support from the central bank."
"A eurozone government, by contrast, is always in a precarious situation: it has only very long-term assets (its taxing power) and shorter-term liabilities, namely government debt, much of which has to be rolled over annually."
"If investors refuse to buy the debt on any terms, even a fiscally prudent government could find itself in a liquidity squeeze and become insolvent."
"Similarly, banks have short-term liabilities (deposits) and long-term assets, which they cannot liquidate quickly without incurring great losses."
"This is why all countries provide emergency liquidity support when a bank run materializes, as was done on a global scale when confidence in the banking sector collapsed alongside Lehman Brothers in 2008."
"Likewise, the eurozone needs a mechanism to confront runs on its member countries’ government debt."
This requires that fiscal authorities have access to a large pool of liquidity in an emergency.
Only the ECB can provide this insurance.
The good news is that a solution is now slowly taking shape that promises to create a mechanism by which the ECB could backstop the EFSF.
"This could be achieved simply by registering the EFSF as a bank, which would give it access to normal ECB refinancing on the same terms as other normal banks."
"The EFSF could then conduct very large purchases of government debt by levering up its limited capital through ECB refinancing, using the government bonds it is buying as collateral."
"In this way, the proper division of labor could be established."
The EFSF would be responsible for dealing with fiscal crises in member states.
"For countries with solvency problems, an adjustment program like those for Greece, Ireland, or Portugal would be appropriate."
"But, for large countries facing a liquidity shortage, the EFSF could rely on support from the ECB."
"If investors know that a liquidity squeeze is no longer possible, they will refrain from speculative attacks on solvent countries."
The near-panic conditions in financial markets eased as soon as rumors spread that this solution had at least been discussed behind closed doors.
It now needs to be implemented.
"As always in Europe, there are legal and political obstacles to change."
But even the most reluctant policymakers recognize that the cost of inaction is too great.
The legal obstacles to potential “monetary financing” of the public sector in the European Union’s governing treaties can be overcome.
The more important obstacle is Germany’s reluctance to admit publicly that ECB liquidity support for government debt markets can be crucial in maintaining financial stability.
Only the German government and the ECB can open the door to this subtle but profound reform of the euro’s fundamental underpinnings.
It is a choice that they cannot put off much longer.
All for One Tax and One Tax for All?
"CAMBRIDGE – When the next full-scale global financial crisis hits, let it not be said that the International Monetary Fund never took a stab at forestalling it."
"Recently, the IMF proposed a new global tax on financial institutions loosely in proportion to their size, as well as a tax on banks’ profits and bonuses."
The Fund’s proposal has been greeted with predictable disdain and derision by the financial industry.
More interesting and significant are the mixed reviews from G-20 presidents and finance ministers.
"Governments at the epicenter of the recent financial crisis, especially the United States and the United Kingdom, are downright enthusiastic, particularly about the tax on size."
"After all, they want to do that anyway."
"Countries that did not experience recent bank meltdowns, such as Canada, Australia, China, Brazil, and India, are unenthusiastic."
Why should they change systems that proved so resilient?
It is all too easy to criticize the specifics of the IMF plan.
But the IMF’s big-picture diagnosis of the problem gets a lot right.
"Financial systems are bloated by implicit taxpayer guarantees, which allow banks, particularly large ones, to borrow money at interest rates that do not fully reflect the risks they take in search of outsized profits."
"Since that risk is then passed on to taxpayers, imposing taxes on financial firms in proportion to their borrowing is a simple way to ensure fairness."
“What risks?” the financial firms demand to know.
The average cost of the bailouts was “only” a few percentage points of GNP.
And the crisis was a once-in-a-half-century event.
The IMF rightly points out that these claims are nonsense.
"During the crisis, taxpayers were on the hook for almost a quarter of national income."
"Perhaps the next crisis will not turn out so “well,” and the losses borne by the public will be staggering."
"Even with the “success” of the bailouts, countries suffered massive output losses due to recessions and sustained subpar growth."
"But, while regulation must address the oversized bank balance sheets that were at the root of the crisis, the IMF is right not to focus excessively on fixing the “too big to fail” problem."
"A surprising number of pundits seem to think that if one could only break up the big banks, governments would be far more resilient to bailouts, and the whole “moral hazard” problem would be muted."
"That logic is dubious, given how many similar crises have hit widely differing systems over the centuries."
A systemic crisis that simultaneously hits a large number of medium-sized banks would put just as much pressure on governments to bail out the system as would a crisis that hits a couple of large banks.
"There are altogether too many complex ideas floating around that look good on paper, but might well prove deeply flawed in a big-time crisis."
Any robust solution must be reasonably simple to understand and implement.
The IMF proposal seems to pass these tests.
"By contrast, some finance specialists favor forcing banks to rely much more on “contingent” debt that can be forcibly converted to (possibly worthless) stock in the event of a system-wide meltdown."
"But how this form of “pre-packaged bankruptcy” could be implemented in a world of widely different legal, political, and banking systems is unclear."
Financial history is littered with untested safety-net devices that failed in a crisis.
Better to rein in the growth of the system.
"The IMF is on much weaker ground, however, in thinking that its one-size-fits-all global tax system will somehow level the playing field internationally."
It won’t.
"Countries that now have solid financial regulatory systems in place are already effectively “taxing” their financial firms more than, say, the US and the UK, where financial regulation is more minimal."
The US and the UK don’t want to weaken their competitive advantage by taxing banks while some other countries do not.
But it is their systems that are in the greatest and most urgent need of stronger checks and balances.
Let’s not go too far in defending the “holdout” countries that are resisting the IMF proposal.
"These countries need to recognize that if the US and the UK do implement even modest reforms, a lot of capital will flow elsewhere, potentially overwhelming regulatory systems that seemed to work well until now."
"And what about the second tax proposed by the IMF, on banks’ profits and bonuses?"
"Such a tax is politically appealing, but ultimately it makes little sense – except, perhaps, in a crisis year when bank subsidies are glaringly transparent."
It would be better to improve financial-market regulation directly and let national tax systems handle banks’ income like that of any other industry.
"The IMF’s first effort at prescribing a cure may be flawed, but its diagnosis of a financial sector bloated by moral hazard is manifestly correct."
"Let’s hope that when the G-20 leaders meet later this year, they decide to take the problem seriously instead of tabling discussion for a decade or two until the next crisis is upon us."
All Man’s Land
"NEW DELHI – Ernest Hemingway’s collection of stories, Men without Women, examines tense gender relationships."
"In a particularly poignant story, a young man convinces his partner to have an abortion, viewing their unborn child as a hindrance to the status quo."
"Frustrated, the woman gives in."
"That story, published more than 80 years ago, remains relevant today in India, where female fetuses face severe risks."
"According to the 2011 census, the sex ratio of the country’s children has dipped from 927 females per 1000 males to 914, a 60-year low."
Ratios in the northern states are particularly alarming: only Himachal Pradesh now has a ratio of girls to boys above 900.
"Despite being illegal, ultrasound sex-determination tests are being used across India to identify for abortion extraordinary numbers of healthy female fetuses."
"But there are serious concerns about legal operations, too."
"Genitoplasty – a sex-change operation on newborn girls – is a mushrooming, and deeply disturbing, business in India."
There’s only one word for it: gendercide.
"Left unchecked, it will leave India’s next generation of men with a severe shortage of women."
"Indian couples have a strong cultural preference, bordering on obsession, for sons over daughters – despite the strides in education and employment that women have made over the last few decades."
"Education and wealth have nothing to do with it – in fact, some of the worst-affected areas are in India’s wealthiest cities."
"However discomfiting a possibility, the real culprit might be Indian culture and tradition itself."
"The expenses and pressure of the dowry system, and the fact that, in most joint families, only sons inherit property and wealth, contribute to this favoritism."
"Perhaps just as important is that sons typically live with their parents even after they are married, and assume responsibility for parents in their old age."
"Daughters, who live with their in-laws after they marry, are viewed as amanat – someone else’s property."
"In short, sons represent income and daughters an expense."
"In the old days, when families typically had 5-10 children, this didn’t matter so much."
The number of sons and daughters often evened out.
"But, for today’s smaller families, whether the children are two boys or two girls influences everything from financial planning to preparations for old age."
Many have argued that Indian women should stand up to their families and refuse to abort their daughters.
But Indian women want male children just as much.
"Unlike Hemingway’s character, they are often more than willing to abort a girl and try for a boy."
The novelist Salman Rushdie once put the question to supporters of abortion rights: “What should be done when a woman uses her power over her own body to discriminate against female fetuses?”
This raises other questions concerning the consequences of a large shortage of girls.
Will women be valued and treasured?
"Or will the oversupply of men result in more bride trafficking, sexual violence, and female suicides?"
"Niall Ferguson, the British historian, cites scholars who attribute Japan’s imperial expansion after 1914 to a male youth bulge, and who link the rise of Islamist extremism to an Islamic youth bulge."
"“Maybe the coming generation of Asian men without women will find harmless outlets for their inevitable frustrations, like team sports or video games. But I doubt it,” he writes."
"He warns us not to be surprised if, in the coming generation, “shrill nationalism is replaced by macho militarism or even imperialism.”"
"Unfortunately, there is no instant solution."
"Saving our girls will require radically altering some of Indian society’s family arrangements, traditions, and attitudes. And there is no easy way to accomplish this."
"Legislation alone won’t help, for tradition is a law unto itself."
"Hindu religious law, for example, allows a woman to claim an equal share in her parents’ wealth, but few exercise this right."
"Culturally, she feels that she does not have an equal claim on her father’s property."
"Nonetheless, India does need new laws – direct and enforceable – that clamp down on the cultural practices that underpin destructive traditions."
"For example, India could enforce a ceiling on wedding expenditure – typically a father’s biggest expense associated with his daughter."
"Constrained from spending on the wedding, he would compensate her differently – perhaps with a larger inheritance."
"Gradually, this would become the norm, and tradition would adjust accordingly. (Interestingly, the state of Kerala, whose people adhere to matrilineal inheritance, has among the most equal sex ratios and literacy rates in India.)"
"A more radical measure, which some have advocated, would be direction intervene, with the state providing benefits for families with more girls."
"Perhaps the authorities could also penalize families with boys, at least temporarily."
"India imagines herself as a woman – Bharat Mata, or Mother India."
"The irony is that, unless far-reaching changes are made soon, Mother India could eventually be the only woman left in the country."
All Quiet on the Burundi Front?
"Like its neighbors, Congo and Rwanda, Burundi is a war-torn land."
"Its troubles have not riveted world attention in recent years, probably because Burundi's rebels failed to plumb the depths of savagery seen in Rwanda and Congo."
"But, unlike its neighbors, this year can mark a turning point for Burundi."
"Thanks to agreements between the rebels and the government that Nelson Mandela and South African Vice President Jacob Zuma helped broker, Burundi can now either turn decisively away from civil strife, or risk a return to the machete politics that have mauled Africa's Great Lakes region for a decade."
"Since its independence from Belgium in 1962, Burundi has suffered five episodes of what amounts to the same civil war."
"About 600,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands made into refugees."
Many portray this war as the result of hatred between the majority Hutu and the minority Tutsi.
But this does not explain why these groups supposedly hate each other so much.
"Burundi's cultural and linguistic homogeneity, rare in Africa, belies the simplistic view that the Hutu and Tutsi fight because they are so different."
"Indeed, most countries are far more heterogeneous than Burundi but have never fallen into ethnic war."
"To understand the dynamics of conflict in Burundi, we need to examine three root causes."
The first such cause is the legacy of colonization.
"In the 1920's and 1930's, the Belgian authorities enacted policies that defined the population along ethnic lines and favored the Tutsi in a deliberate - and successful - effort to divide society and fan resentment among Hutu leaders."
"Second, the bloody 1959 revolution in Rwanda, a country mirroring Burundi's ethnic and social structure, induced Burundi's Tutsi to cling even more tightly to power."
"At the same time, Burundi's Hutu saw Rwanda as a role model and believed their ethnic majority should guarantee them de facto control of the country."
"Third, successive governments widened the ethnic divide through catastrophically predatory governance."
"A tiny elite of Tutsi from the southern province of Bururi controlled all institutions, exploiting them to the fullest."
The army brutally suppressed any opposition to Bururi rule.
"No surprise, then, that millions of Burundians felt alienated, and that many resorted to violence."
"In October 1993, the killing by members of the army of Melchior Ndadaye, the first civilian, Hutu, non-Bururi, and democratically elected president provoked a bloody reaction by the Hutu."
"Presidential assassinations do not necessarily lead to civil wars, but in Burundi, a large-scale massacre of Tutsi civilians by Hutu immediately followed the coup attempt."
"Fearing retribution by the Tutsi-dominated army, large numbers of Hutu fled the country while armed rebels engaged the army."
"For the first time, the army failed to crush the rebellion."
"As a result, the Tutsi-dominated government entered into negotiations with Hutu leaders, which led to the signing of a political accord in August 2000."
But the accord had a major flaw: the absence of a cease-fire.
"Violence only receded in 2003, when the main rebel group, the"
These breakthroughs came about thanks to the dedicated mediation of Mandela and Zuma.
"The presidents of Uganda and Tanzania, and the international community in general, also exerted leverage."
"(Burundi is an aid-dependent country, so donors have considerable sway in influencing its rulers' behavior.)"
The question now is whether each party will honor its commitments.
What guarantees exist that the rebel groups will fully demobilize?
Why should the rebels believe that the government will honor its commitments once they no longer represent a threat?
"Neither party, it seems, can commit credibly to peace."
Burundi's donors need to join hands with African leaders to make certain that the agreements are implemented.
Everyone agrees that recent pledges of a $1 billion in aid are a sign that donors are ready to show Burundians that peace has a dividend.
But aid will help build peace only if it is carefully used.
It must be distributed to the needy rather than favoring the elite - a tendency established in the past.
"Yet it would be dangerous to redress past imbalances solely at the expense of traditional beneficiaries, especially because they remain powerful enough to derail the peace process."
It is encouraging to note that Burundi's leaders have so far managed to integrate leaders from the opposition and rebel groups into the country's political and military institutions without dismissing incumbents.
The danger is that applying this approach rigorously will invariably result in a bloated civil service and army.
"But while downsizing government may be fashionable in the West, now is not the time for slimming down Burundi's state sector."
"For once, over employment is politically justified."
The international community must understand that the political benefits of not alienating the old elite while offering new opportunities to traditionally excluded groups outweigh the financial cost.
Burundi will need even deeper pockets from its donors to transform today's political overtures into sustainable peace.
All Stimulus Roads Lead to China
"BEIJING – Now that the “green shoots” of recovery have withered, the debate over fiscal stimulus is back with a vengeance."
"In the United States, those who argue for another stimulus package observe that it was always wishful thinking to believe that a $787 billion package could offset a $3 trillion fall in private spending."
But unemployment has risen even faster and further than expected.
"Combine this with the continued fall in housing prices, and it is understandable that consumer spending remains depressed."
"The banks, having been recapitalized only to the extent necessary to keep them afloat, still have weak balance sheets."
Their consequent reluctance to lend constrains investment.
"Meanwhile, state governments, seeing revenues fall as a result of lower taxable incomes last year, are cutting back like mad."
"If there was a case for additional stimulus back in February, that case is even stronger now."
But the case against additional stimulus is also strong.
"The US federal deficit is an alarming 12% of GDP, and public debt as a share of national income is already projected to double, to 80% of GDP."
"The idea that the US can grow out of its debt burden, as did Finland and Sweden following their financial crises in the 1990’s, seems unrealistic."
"Given all this, more deficit spending will only stoke fears of higher future taxes and inflation."
It will encourage the reemergence of global imbalances.
And it will not reassure consumers or investors.
"It is possible to argue the economics both ways, but the politics all point in one direction."
The US Congress lacks the stomach for another stimulus package.
It has already faced intense criticism for its failure to get the country’s fiscal house in order.
"The slowness with which the first stimulus has been rolled out, and the fact that it will take even more time for its full effects to be felt, provides more fodder for the chattering classes."
Disappointment over the effects of the TARP has already destroyed popular – and Congressional – support for more public money to recapitalize the banks.
"So, even those who find the economic logic of arguments for fiscal activism compelling must acknowledge that the politics are not supportive."
A second stimulus simply is not in the cards.
"If there is going to be more aggregate demand, it can come from only one place."
"That place is not Europe or Japan, where debts are even higher than in the US – and the demographic preconditions for servicing them less favorable."
"Rather, it is emerging markets like China."
"The problem is that China has already done a lot to stimulate domestic demand, both through government spending and by directing its banks to lend."
"As a result, its stock market is frothy, and it is experiencing an alarming property boom."
"Through May, property prices were up 18% year on year."
"Understandably, Chinese officials worry about bubble trouble."
The obvious way to square this circle is to spend more on imports.
"China can purchase more industrial machinery, transport equipment, and steelmaking material, which are among its leading imports from the US."
"Directing spending toward imports of capital equipment would avoid overheating China’s own markets, boost the economy’s productive capacity (and thus its ability to grow in the future), and support demand for US, European, and Japanese products just when such support is needed most."
This strategy is not without risks.
"Allowing the renminbi to appreciate as a way of encouraging imports may also discourage exports, the traditional motor of Chinese growth."
And lowering administrative barriers to imports might redirect more spending toward foreign goods than the authorities intend.
But these are risks worth taking if China is serious about assuming a global leadership role.
The question is what China will get in return.
"And the answer brings us back, full circle, to where we started, namely to US fiscal policy."
China is worried that its more than $1 trillion investment in US Treasury securities will not hold its value.
It wants reassurance that the US will stand behind its debts.
It therefore wants to see a credible program for balancing the US budget once the recession ends.
"And, tough talk notwithstanding, the Obama administration has yet to offer a credible roadmap for fiscal consolidation."
Doing so would reassure American taxpayers worried about current deficits.
"Just as importantly, it would reassure Chinese policymakers."
We live in a multipolar world where neither the US nor China is large enough to exercise global economic leadership on its own.
"For China, leadership means assuming additional risks."
"But for this to be tolerable, the US needs to relieve China of existing risks."
Only by working together can the two countries lead the world economy out of its current doldrums.
All the Queen’s Children
"NEW YORK – Does monarchy – constitutional monarchy, that is, not the despotic kind – have any redeeming features left?"
The arguments against maintaining kings and queens are mostly quite rational.
It is unreasonable in this democratic age to pay special deference to people solely on the basis of their birth.
"Are we really supposed to admire and love modern monarchies, such as the British House of Windsor, even more so today, just because some new princess has been plucked from the middle class?"
Monarchy has an infantilizing effect.
Witness how otherwise sensible adults are reduced to nervously grinning sycophants when they are granted the privilege of touching an extended royal hand.
"At great monarchical displays, such as the royal wedding in London, millions become enthralled by child-like dreams of a “fairy-tale” marriage."
"The mystique of immense wealth, noble birth, and great exclusivity is further sustained by the global mass media that promote these rituals."
"Now, one might argue that the dignified pomp of Queen Elizabeth II is preferable to the tawdry grandiosity of Silvio Berlusconi, Madonna, or Cristiano Ronaldo."
"In fact, the British monarchy, especially, has been reinventing itself by adopting many of the most vulgar features of modern showbiz or sports celebrity."
And the worlds of royalty and popular fame often overlap.
"For example, David Beckham and his ex-pop-star wife Victoria, live out their own dream of royalty, aping some of its gaudiest aspects."
They also happened to be among the favored guests at the latest royal wedding.
"Similarly, while Britain has many outstanding musicians, the favorite of the royal court is Elton John."
"Infantile or not, there is a common human craving for taking vicarious pleasure in the lives of kings, queens, and other shining stars."
To call these people’s ostentatious displays of extravagance wasteful is to miss the point: a world of glittering dreams that must remain entirely beyond our grasp is precisely what many people want to see.
"But there is another, darker side to this craving, which is the wish to see idols dragged through the mud in vicious gossip magazines, divorce courts, and so on."
"This is the vengeful side of our fawning, as though the humiliation of worshipping idols must be balanced by our delight in their downfall."
"Indeed, to subject people who are born into royal families, or people who marry into them, to lives in a fishbowl, where they are on constant display, like actors and actresses in a continuous soap opera, where human relations are distorted and stunted by absurd rules of protocol, is a terrible form of cruelty."
"The current Japanese empress and her daughter-in-law, both from non-aristocratic families, have had nervous breakdowns as a result."
"Likewise, movie stars often fall victim to alcohol, drugs, and breakdowns, but at least they have chosen the lives they live."
"Kings and queens, on the whole, have not."
"Prince Charles might have been far happier as a gardener, but this was never an option."
"One thing to be said for monarchs is that they provide people with a sense of continuity, which can be useful in times of crisis or radical change."
The King of Spain provided stability and continuity after the end of Franco’s dictatorship.
"During World War II, European monarchs kept a sense of hope and unity alive among their subjects under Nazi occupation."
"But there is something else, too. Monarchies are often popular with minorities."
Jews were among the most loyal subjects of the Austro-Hungarian Emperor.
Franz Joseph I stood up for his Jewish subjects when they were threatened by German anti-Semites.
"To him, Jews, Germans, Czechs, or Hungarians were all his subjects, wherever they lived, from the smallest Galician shtetl to the grand capitals of Budapest or Vienna."
This offered some protection to minorities at a time of rising ethnic nationalism.
"In this sense, monarchy is a little like Islam, or the Catholic Church: all believers are supposed to be equal in the eyes of God, or the Pope, or the Emperor – hence the appeal to the poor and the marginalized."
This might explain some right-wing populists’ animus against monarchy.
"The Dutch populist leader Geert Wilders, for example, has denounced Queen Beatrix on several occasions as a leftist, elitist, and multiculturalist."
"Like the new wave of populists worldwide, Wilders promises to take his country back for his followers, to stop immigration (especially of Muslims), and to make the Netherlands Dutch again, whatever that means."
"Beatrix, like Franz Joseph, refuses to make ethnic or religious distinctions between her subjects."
That is what she means when she preaches tolerance and mutual understanding.
"To Wilders and his supporters, this is a sign of her molly-coddling of aliens, of appeasing Muslims."
"To them, the queen seems almost anti-Dutch."
"To be sure, like all European royal families, the origins of the Dutch royal family are decidedly mixed."
The emergence of kings and queens as specifically national figureheads is a relatively recent historical development.
"Empires contained many nations, after all."
"Queen Victoria, mostly of German blood, did not regard herself as a monarch of Britons alone, but of Indians, Malays, and many other peoples, too."
This aristocratic tradition of standing above the narrow strains of ethnic nationalism may be the best argument to hang on to royalty a little longer.
"Now that many European nations have become increasingly mixed in terms of ethnicity and culture, the only way forward is to learn to live together."
"If monarchs can teach their subjects to do so, then let us give at least one cheer for the remaining kings and queens."
Alternatives to Alternative Energy
VIRGINIA BEACH – The problem of long-term energy sources has been drifting towards crisis for decades.
"Indeed, the catastrophes in Japan might finally achieve what decades of conflict in the Middle East have not: compel governments to invest in the research required to develop viable energy alternatives."
"The immediate political response to the Japanese disaster will be to make small re-adjustments among known energy sources, including wind and solar."
But the current options that many governments wish to embrace will not do the job.
"Production of the materials used to capture and store solar electricity, for example, can cause just as much environmental damage as conventional fuels, and existing wind and solar technology cannot easily meet the needs of large populations."
"Of course, fossil fuels, mainly coal and natural gas, remain important, but their extraction and use is tied to groundwater pollution and carbon-dioxide emissions, especially in North America and China."
"The tragedy in Japan reminds us that, though nuclear energy emits no CO2, it is toxic in other ways."
"If there was ever a time for a massive investment in research into long-term energy sources, that time is now."
"We need something on the scale of the Manhattan Project (which created the atomic bomb), or the Apollo Program (which put a man on the moon)."
Both initiatives succeeded in a short period of time and at a relatively low price.
"In current dollars, each cost about $200 billion – a mere fraction of what the United States has paid for the Iraq war, and less than the cost implied by the rise in oil prices over the past year."
Both the Apollo Program and the Manhattan Project had unique characteristics.
Each marshaled the sharpest minds from a range of countries to address one task.
"Tolerance for failure was slim in both initiatives, so they tended to rely on the previous generation of scientific insight, because the resulting technology was more trustworthy."
"Neither entailed a great scientific challenge, but rather a vast engineering problem."
"Although invention was required, existing scientific methods were used."
"Unfortunately, governments now focus only on one aspect of this investment format, in which technology that is almost ready is funded."
But this results in endless efforts to make non-ideal methods less troublesome.
"We need a game changer, like the integrated circuit, radio, or electricity."
"Such a paradigm shift requires an Apollo-scale investment, but in basic science."
"There are several examples of the kind of phenomena that, with the benefit of new insight, could lead to unexpected energy sources."
"Quite apart from daily sunlight, for instance, Earth is bombarded by all sorts of other radiation from outside our solar system."
"Some of this we understand, but most of the material in the universe, and the forces associated with it, are not well explained."
"There is most likely an exploitable galactic source of energy that is constant, unlimited, and in our sky right now."
"Without basic research to help us understand these forces, their potential will elude us."
An even more mysterious effect occurs on Earth with living creatures.
"According to general laws of physics, everything tends to disorder – a process known as entropy."
"Less well understood is why some agents do the opposite, tending toward order and structure."
"Plants, for example, interact with their environment to produce locally ordered systems, resulting in the creation of wood (and other biomass)."
"When we burn wood, we reverse the process, unraveling that order and producing energy."
"At this simple level, we understand how nature works."
"But in more complex cases, in which living beings collaborate to build societies or create knowledge, our scientific models are inadequate."
"This has prompted some scientists to begin investigating new models of energy from the perspective of “intelligence and information,” in which order is equivalent to information."
"With such a fresh perspective on matter, new potentials could emerge."
"For example, consider methane clathrate, an ice-like stone that in most cases is built in an ordered way by a complex collaboration of microbes."
"Global deposits of methane clathrate contain more than twice the amount of energy of all known fossil fuels, and it can burn cleanly."
"If not burned in a controlled way, the release of raw clathrates into the atmosphere would represent a global climate threat, and past massive releases have been catastrophic."
But a better understanding of biological “information flow” could help us use methane clathrate in ways that could actually counter global warming.
"Solutions such as these are not explored, however, because they are not within obviously immediate reach, as the atomic bomb and the lunar landing were."
"So, perhaps a radically new approach to research is also needed."
"Given humanity’s common interest in new energy sources, it seems that the world’s brightest scientific minds should collaborate to identify them."
"Such a project would flourish in a scientific establishment that is maturing, rather than frozen in its methods."
"Whereas Japan, the US, and Europe are competent at research into what is almost known, the cutting-edge science is more likely to emerge in an economy hungry for resources and infrastructure, such as China."
"Rather than a single laboratory, such a program could be a distributed virtual enterprise, taking advantage of the sort of innovative industrial collaboration in which China currently excels."
"We need fundamental breakthroughs in alternative energy sources, and soon."
"Getting them will probably require a large, collaborative effort focused on theoretical science."
Changing our approach to research in this way might seem more difficult than using what we already have.
"But, as with our natural resources, we are running out of options."
Alternatives to Austerity
"NEW YORK – In the aftermath of the Great Recession, countries have been left with unprecedented peacetime deficits and increasing anxieties about their growing national debts."
"In many countries, this is leading to a new round of austerity – policies that will almost surely lead to weaker national and global economies and a marked slowdown in the pace of recovery."
"Those hoping for large deficit reductions will be sorely disappointed, as the economic slowdown will push down tax revenues and increase demands for unemployment insurance and other social benefits."
The attempt to restrain the growth of debt does serve to concentrate the mind – it forces countries to focus on priorities and assess values.
"The United States is unlikely in the short term to embrace massive budget cuts, à la the United Kingdom."
But the long-term prognosis – made especially dire by health-care reform’s inability to make much of a dent in rising medical costs – is sufficiently bleak that there is increasing bipartisan momentum to do something.
"President Barack Obama has appointed a bipartisan deficit-reduction commission, whose chairmen recently provided a glimpse of what their report might look like."
"Technically, reducing a deficit is a straightforward matter: one must either cut expenditures or raise taxes."
"It is already clear, however, that the deficit-reduction agenda, at least in the US, goes further: it is an attempt to weaken social protections, reduce the progressivity of the tax system, and shrink the role and size of government – all while leaving established interests, like the military-industrial complex, as little affected as possible."
"In the US (and some other advanced industrial countries), any deficit-reduction agenda has to be set in the context of what happened over the last decade:"
"·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a massive increase in defense expenditures, fueled by two fruitless wars, but going well beyond that;"
"·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; growth in inequality, with the top 1% garnering more than 20% of the country’s income, accompanied by a weakening of the middle class – median US household income has fallen by more than 5% over the past decade, and was in decline even before the recession;"
"·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; underinvestment in the public sector, including in infrastructure, evidenced so dramatically by the collapse of New Orleans’ levies; and"
"·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; growth in corporate welfare, from bank bailouts to ethanol subsidies to a continuation of agricultural subsidies, even when those subsidies have been ruled illegal by the World Trade Organization."
"As a result, it is relatively easy to formulate a deficit-reduction package that boosts efficiency, bolsters growth, and reduces inequality."
Five core ingredients are required.
"First, spending on high-return public investments should be increased."
"Even if this widens the deficit in the short run, it will reduce the national debt in the long run."
What business wouldn’t jump at investment opportunities yielding returns in excess of 10% if it could borrow capital – as the US government can – for less than 3% interest?
"Second, military expenditures must be cut – not just funding for the fruitless wars, but also for the weapons that don’t work against enemies that don’t exist."
"We’ve continued as if the Cold War never came to an end, spending as much on defense as the rest of the world combined."
Following this is the need to eliminate corporate welfare.
"Even as America has stripped away its safety net for people, it has strengthened the safety net for firms, evidenced so clearly in the Great Recession with the bailouts of AIG, Goldman Sachs, and other banks."
"Corporate welfare accounts for nearly one-half of total income in some parts of US agro-business, with billions of dollars in cotton subsidies, for example, going to a few rich farmers – while lowering prices and increasing poverty among competitors in the developing world."
An especially egregious form of corporate special treatment is that afforded to the drug companies.
"Even though the government is the largest buyer of their products, it is not allowed to negotiate prices, thereby fueling an estimated increase in corporate revenues – and costs to the government – approaching $1 trillion dollars over a decade."
"Another example is the smorgasbord of special benefits provided to the energy sector, especially oil and gas, thereby simultaneously robbing the treasury, distorting resource allocation, and destroying the environment."
Then there are the seemingly endless giveaways of national resources – from the free spectrum provided to broadcasters to the low royalties levied on mining companies to the subsidies to lumber companies.
"Creating a fairer and more efficient tax system, by eliminating the special treatment of capital gains and dividends, is also needed."
Why should those who work for a living be subject to higher tax rates than those who reap their livelihood from speculation (often at the expense of others)?
"Finally, with more than 20% of all income going to the top 1%, a slight increase, say 5%, in taxes actually paid would bring in&nbsp;more than $1 trillion over the course of a decade."
A deficit-reduction package crafted along these lines would more than meet even the most ardent deficit hawk’s demands.
"It would increase efficiency, promote growth, improve the environment, and benefit workers and the middle class."
"There’s only one problem: it wouldn’t benefit those at the top, or the corporate and other special interests that have come to dominate America’s policymaking."
Its compelling logic is precisely why there is little chance that such a reasonable proposal would ever be adopted.
Effective Altruism
PRINCETON – Can humans really be motivated by altruism?
"My new book, The Most Good You Can Do, discusses the emerging new movement called Effective Altruism, and, in doing interviews about the book, I am surprised by how often that question is asked."
"Why should we doubt that some people act altruistically, at least some of the time?"
"In evolutionary terms, we can easily understand altruism toward kin and others who can reciprocate our help."
"It seems plausible that once our ability to reason and reflect has developed sufficiently enough to enable us to understand that strangers can suffer and enjoy life just as we can, then at least some of us would act altruistically toward strangers, too."
"The polling organization Gallup asked people in 135 countries whether they had, in the last month, donated money to a charity, volunteered their time to an organization, or helped a stranger."
"Gallup’s results, which form the basis of the World Giving Index 2014, indicate that approximately 2.3 billion people, a third of the world’s population, perform at least one altruistic act per month."
More objective evidence of altruism buttresses these findings.
"In many countries, the supply of blood for medical purposes relies on voluntary, anonymous donations."
"Worldwide, more than 11 million people have put their names on donor registries for bone marrow, signifying their willingness to donate their marrow to a stranger."
"A small but growing number of people have gone further still, donating a kidney to a stranger."
There were 177 altruistic donations by living donors in the United States in 2013 and 118 in the United Kingdom in the year to April 2014.
Then there are those who donate to charity.
"In the US alone, individuals gave $240 billion to charity in 2013."
"Foundations and corporations topped this up to a total of $335 billion, or about 2% of gross national income."
"The US is often said to be more charitable than other countries; but, in terms of the proportion of the population donating money, Myanmar, Malta, Ireland, the UK, Canada, the Netherlands, and Iceland all do better."
"In Myanmar, 91% of the people surveyed had given money in the past month (the corresponding figure for the US is 68%), indicating the strong hold of the Theravada Buddhist tradition of donating to support monks and nuns."
Myanmar also had the highest percentage of people volunteering time (51%).
"The US did, however, have the highest ranking for “helping a stranger.”"
"That, together with a high ranking for volunteering time, led it to tie with Myanmar as the most generous nation in the world."
"Admittedly, not all of this giving is altruistic."
"New York’s Lincoln Center announced last month that the billionaire entertainment industry mogul David Geffen has donated $100 million toward the renovation of its concert facility, Avery Fisher Hall, on the condition that it is renamed David Geffen Hall."
That gift seems motivated more by a desire for fame than a desire to do good.
"After all, as Geffen presumably knew, the family of Avery Fisher had to be compensated with a payment of $15 million in order to agree to the renaming."
"In any case, in a world with a billion people living in extreme poverty, it would not be difficult for an altruist to appreciate that there are many ways of doing more good than renovating a concert hall for well-off music lovers."
"At the opposite end of the giving spectrum, psychologists who study giving behavior have suggested that people who give small sums of money to a large number of charities may be motivated less by the desire to help others than by the warm glow they get from making a donation."
"By contrast, other donors give larger sums, usually to only a handful of charities chosen on the basis of some knowledge about what the charity is doing."
They want to have a positive impact on the world.
"Their gifts may also make their lives better, but this is not what motivates them."
"The Effective Altruism movement consists of people who give in the latter way, combining the head and the heart."
Their aim is to do the most good they can with the resources that they are willing to set aside for that purpose.
"Those resources may include a tenth, a quarter, or even half of their income."
"Their altruism may include their time and talents, and influence their choice of career."
"To achieve their aims, they use reason and evidence to ensure that whatever resources they devote to doing good will be as effective as possible."
Several studies show that people who are generous are typically happier and more satisfied with their lives than those who do not give.
And other studies show that giving leads to activity in the reward centers of the brain (the areas of the brain that are also stimulated by tasty food and sex).
But this does not mean that these donors are not altruistic.
"Their direct motive is to help others, and their giving makes them happier only as a consequence of the fact that it does help others."
"If we had more such people, we would have more giving, and that is what we want."
To define “altruism” so narrowly that the term can be applied only when giving is contrary to a person’s overall interest would miss the point that the best situation to bring about is one in which promoting the interests of others harmonizes with promoting one’s own.
Testing Times for Alzheimer’
LONDON – Alzheimer’s disease is by far the most common cause of dementia and one of the world’s most feared disorders.
"By 2050, there will be 135 million Alzheimer’s sufferers worldwide, a threefold increase from today, with three-quarters of cases occurring in low- and middle-income countries."
"Predicting the onset of Alzheimer’s, let alone preventing or curing it, remains an immense challenge."
Alzheimer’s disease was identified more than a century ago from autopsy results that showed characteristic brain lesions called “amyloid plaques.”
The disease is more difficult to diagnose in the living.
"Doctors rely on observation of memory loss and other thinking deficits (such as reasoning or language comprehension) – signs that plaques are already present in the brain. But any cure&nbsp;would have to be administered before the plaques form, and years before symptoms of dementia appear."
Alzheimer’s might be more predictable if scientists had the time and resources to conduct far-reaching longitudinal studies over many years.
"Such studies ideally would involve blood, imaging, memory, and medical tests, as well as detailed lifestyle questionnaires filled out by thousands of young and middle-aged people."
"Study participants would be followed over decades to see who developed the disease, and which tests proved positive before Alzheimer’s was diagnosed."
"In fact, two famous longitudinal studies – the Framingham Heart Study in Massachusetts and the Kungsholmen Project in Sweden – have led to important progress in predicting the disease."
These studies found that short-term memory may be impaired for up to ten years before an Alzheimer’s diagnosis.
"Major advances have since been made in brain imaging, biochemical analysis, and, perhaps most important, genetic testing."
"Indeed, the risk of Alzheimer’s doubles if a parent or sibling has it, probably due in large part to the presence of the ApoE gene."
"The risk triples for Europeans who inherit a particular type of ApoE, called ε4; inheriting two copies of ε4 increases the risk roughly tenfold."
"But genetic testing alone is unlikely to be an accurate predictor, because around half of Alzheimer’s sufferers do not carry ε4, and probably half of those with ε4 do not develop the disease."
"Moreover, though international studies of more than 70,000 people have found over 20 other genes linked to Alzheimer’s, their impact is minimal."
"That said, a&nbsp;groundbreaking 2012 study&nbsp;published in the&nbsp;New England Journal of Medicine, analyzed a rare genetic mutation found in just 500 families around the world, which would lead to Alzheimer’s before the age of 50."
The study showed which tests were able to predict the outcome most accurately decades ahead of onset.
The research found that amyloid-beta – the substance that clumps together and forms amyloid plaques – becomes depleted in the cerebrospinal fluid around the brain as long as 25 years before the onset of dementia.
"Fifteen years prior to onset, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed amyloid-beta being deposited in plaques in the brain itself. And detailed short-term memory tests were abnormal ten years before onset, as suggested in the Framingham and Kungsholmen studies."
"These tests are now becoming part of clinical practice, and are available commercially."
Memory and other cognitive tests can reveal whether one has minor problems with some aspects of thinking – a condition known as “mild cognitive impairment” that precedes Alzheimer’s disease.
"The problem is that the tests must be administered by a trained neuropsychologist and take more than an hour to complete; moreover, many people with mild cognitive impairment do not progress to dementia."
"Sampling cerebrospinal fluid via a lumbar puncture (or “spinal tap”) can predict which people with mild cognitive impairment will progress to dementia with over 80% accuracy, but this still means a misdiagnosis for one in five patients."
"PET scans are slightly less accurate, while routine MRI brain scans can reveal with perhaps only 70% accuracy subtle abnormalities in people with mild cognitive impairment."
"Scientists are therefore still searching for an accurate predictive test that is cheaper, quicker, and less invasive than PET scans or lumbar punctures."
"This year, two small studies of blood tests seemed to predict Alzheimer’s 1-3 years before it occurred, but the tests are complicated and require the measurement of ten or more substances."
Whichever predictive methods doctors use over the next few years will probably enable them to inform those patients with mild cognitive impairment about their chances of developing Alzheimer’s in the short term.
"The trickier question is whether we will be able to predict Alzheimer’s disease accurately in those with normal cognition and memory, or to predict it more than five years in advance."
"Even if accurate early prediction of Alzheimer’s eventually is achieved, there are currently no drugs available to prevent or cure it before the amyloid plaques start destroying the mind."
A Man against the Machine
"WASHINGTON, DC ­– America’s financial sector has shown renewed strength in recent months – political strength, that is – by undermining most of the sensible proposals for banking reform that remain on the table."
"If we are still making any progress at all, it is because of the noble efforts of a small number of United States senators."
"Most notable has been the work of Senator Ted Kaufman, a Democrat from Delaware (yes, a pro-business state), who has pressed tirelessly to fix the most egregious problems in the US financial sector."
"Kaufman understands that successful reform requires three ingredients: arguments that persuade, the ability to bring colleagues along, and a good deal of luck in the form of events that highlight problems at just the right time."
"On two fronts, Kaufman has – against long odds – actually managed to make substantial steps."
"Long before it became fashionable, Kaufman persisted with the idea that the US real estate boom was fueled in part by pervasive fraud within the mortgage-securitization-derivatives complex, effectively at the heart of Wall Street."
This thesis is now gaining much broader traction – major newspapers now report a broadening criminal probe by the federal government – and by New York’s state attorney general – into the US financial sector’s residential lending and related securities practices.
"With Senators Patrick Leahy and Chuck Grassley, Kaufman worked last year to pass a bill providing timely resources to federal law enforcement agencies working on recent financial fraud."
"More recently, Kaufman was devastating in his cross-examination of Goldman Sachs executives."
"Senator Carl Levin, chairman of the subcommittee that heard their testimony, evidently seeing eye to eye with Kaufman, was just as tough after a year-long investigation of Washington Mutual, Goldman, and the abject failures of bank regulators and credit rating agencies."
"Kaufman scored an even bigger coup with his warnings about the dangers of the explosive growth of high-frequency trading, which is little understood by America’s main financial watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and poses systemic market risk."
"His concerns appear to have been vindicated by the 20-minute shutdown of trading in New York on May 6, when the stock market completely failed in its most basic function: price discovery between buyers and sellers."
"We do not yet know what combination of black-box computer programs and electronic trading algorithms, interacting across more than 50 market centers, caused this catastrophe."
But our lack of knowledge itself confirms how far our regulatory and surveillance capabilities have fallen behind “financial innovation.”
Kaufman’s approach – with speeches on the Senate floor as a central feature – seemed irrelevant or even quaint to critics even a few weeks ago.
No significant Wall Street voices acknowledged his concerns – preferring instead to praise the equity markets as a shining example of well-functioning technology.
Now people get it.
"As Senator Mark Warner graciously acknowledged, “The Senator from Delaware sounded an early warning signal that the massive amounts of investments that had been made by certain firms to try to get what appears to be a fractional millisecond advantage in the trading process might come back and haunt us all... I’ve been proud to follow his lead.”"
The SEC was once a great and powerful independent agency.
It fell on hard times in recent decades and is only beginning to get its act together under new leadership.
Yet it still does not routinely collect the data that it needs – trades by time and customer – to understand the actions and impact of large traders.
"Kaufman has consistently pressed them to do more – and do it much faster; to be sure, they and many others are now listening."
"On a third issue, the results so far are mixed."
"Kaufman championed the case for making America’s biggest banks smaller, as part of comprehensive financial-reform efforts."
"His advocacy helped build support and forced a Senate floor vote on an amendment, co-sponsored with Senator Sherrod Brown, that would have imposed a hard cap on banks’ size and leverage (debt relative to assets)."
"The amendment was moderate and entirely reasonable, yet it went down to defeat, 33-61, also on May 6."
It might have gained more support just a few days later – after senators witnessed the bailout of the giant eurozone banks.
"Still, it has strengthened backing for another amendment, sponsored by Senators Jeff Merkley and Carl Levin, which would restrict proprietary trading by megabanks for their own account – coincidentally a practice that is presumed to be a large and “dark” part of high-speed trading."
The deeper and overriding point of Kaufman’s critique of our system is the need for tough laws.
We cannot merely rely on regulators to do the right thing.
"In particular, regulators have no chance to look over the horizon and act preventively when markets are opaque, and when powerful Wall Street interests (and their Capitol Hill allies) can circle the wagons and claim that there is no problem."
"Unfortunately, despite his newfound prominence on the national stage, Kaufman will be out of office at the end of this year – he was appointed to fill Vice President Joe Biden’s seat at the end of 2008 and committed at that time not to run for re-election."
"When he goes, dangerous elements on Wall Street will no doubt breathe a sigh of relief."
Let’s hope that by then he will have helped move the consensus permanently among his colleagues – preparing the ground for further congressional action aimed at a serious tightening of safeguards over the financial sector.
"Kaufman’s lasting legacy will be a simple and powerful idea that reasonable people increasingly find to be self-evident: relying on deregulation and self-interest in today’s complex, opaque markets will manifestly fail to produce a reasonable allocation of capital or support entrepreneurship and growth."
We must write and enforce laws that restore credibility to our financial markets.
A Mania for Diagnosing Bipolar Disorder
"PROVIDENCE, RI – During the past few years, many experts have suggested that bipolar disorder – a serious illness resulting in significant psychosocial morbidity and excess mortality – is under-recognized, particularly in patients with major depression."
Even patients who are diagnosed with bipolar disorder often wait more than 10 years after initially seeking treatment for the correct diagnosis to be made.
"The clinical implications of the failure to recognize bipolar disorder in depressed patients include the under-prescription of mood-stabilizing medications, and an increased risk of rapid “cycling” – swings between manic and depressive phases."
"But, perhaps as a consequence of concerted efforts to improve the recognition of bipolar disorder, during the past few years we have observed the emergence of an opposite phenomenon – over-diagnosis."
"In my own practice, my colleagues and I have encountered patients who reported that they were previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder, despite lacking a history of manic or hypomanic episodes."
"To be sure, we have also seen patients seeking treatment for depression who really did have bipolar disorder."
"However, there seemed to be more over-diagnosis than under-diagnosis."
We therefore conducted a study to examine empirically how often bipolar disorder might be over- and under-diagnosed.
Seven hundred psychiatric outpatients were interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) and completed a self-administered questionnaire that asked whether they had been previously diagnosed by a health-care professional with bipolar or manic-depressive disorder.
Family history information was obtained from the patient regarding their immediate relatives.
"Slightly more than 20% (145 patients) in our sample reported that they had been previously diagnosed as having bipolar disorder, significantly higher than the 12.9% rate based on the SCID."
Less than half of those who reported that they had been previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder were diagnosed with bipolar disorder based on the SCID.
Patients with SCID-diagnosed bipolar disorder had a significantly higher risk of bipolar disorder in their immediate family members than patients who self-reported a previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder that was not confirmed by the SCID.
Patients who self-reported a previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder that was not confirmed by the SCID did not have a significantly higher risk for bipolar disorder than the patients who were negative for bipolar disorder by self-report and the SCID.
"Our findings, validated by family history, thus suggest that bipolar disorder was over-diagnosed."
Any study seeking to determine whether a psychiatric disorder is over-diagnosed will find that some patients with the condition do not have it upon re-interview.
Such is the nature of the imperfect reliability of psychiatric diagnosis.
"The question, then, is not whether"
Over-diagnosis of bipolar disorder has costs.
"Mood stabilizers are the treatment of choice, and, depending on the medication, they can produce potentially significant health complications affecting renal, endocrine, hepatic, immunologic, or metabolic function. Thus, over-diagnosing bipolar disorder can unnecessarily expose patients to serious side-effects of medication."
The impact of marketing efforts by pharmaceutical companies and publicity probably plays a role in the emerging tendency to over-diagnose bipolar disorder. Direct-to-consumer advertisements that refer individuals to screening questionnaires can result in patients suggesting to their doctors that they have bipolar disorder.
We have seen evidence of this in our practice.
"This does not necessarily reflect a problem with the performance of a screening questionnaire, but rather how these scales are used."
"Screening questionnaires maximize sensitivity, at a cost of false positives, because it is presumed that they are followed by expert clinical evaluation. But insufficient diagnostic rigor can result in over-diagnosis."
Clinicians are inclined to diagnose disorders that they feel more comfortable treating.
We believe that the increased availability of medications that have been approved for the treatment of bipolar disorder might be influencing clinicians who are unsure whether or not a patient has bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder to err on the side of diagnosing the disorder that is responsive to medication.
"This bias is reinforced by the marketing message of pharmaceutical companies to physicians, which has emphasized research on delayed diagnosis and under-recognition of bipolar disorder, possibly sensitizing clinicians accordingly."
"The campaign against under-recognition has probably resulted in some anxious, agitated, and/or irritable depressed patients who complain of insomnia and “racing thoughts” being misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder."
The results of our study are consistent with prior studies suggesting possible problems with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder.
"With the greater number of medications approved for the treatment of bipolar disorder, along with multiple reports cautioning clinicians against under-diagnosis, it appears that over-diagnosis has become a greater problem than under-diagnosis."
"Both can have negative consequences. While there is still some uncertainty as to the best assessment approach, we recommend that clinicians use a standardized, validated method."
A Marshall Plan for the Arab World
ROME – US President Barack Obama’s major speech on the consequences of the Arab Spring is also a challenge for Europe.
"Only if the trans-Atlantic partnership proves effective, as it did to meet the demands of the Cold War and the end of Europe’s division, can the West contribute to realizing the hopes engendered by the Arab uprisings."
"The crisis in Europe’s southern neighborhood reflects a deep-seated transformation process that will have long-lasting consequences – for the region, for Europe, and for the world."
"The Mediterranean region is vital to Europe’s peace, stability, and economic growth."
"The continent’s Mediterranean neighbors look to Europe as their natural partner. And events there, including the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, have a broader impact that naturally entails the close involvement of global partners – first and foremost the United States."
"Current events, not just in Libya, but also in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, Yemen, and Bahrain, mirror the political complexity of these countries."
"They also spring from different factors, such as frustration with rising food prices and widespread corruption, coupled with demands for greater democratization, reduction of economic and social inequalities, and job creation."
Europe’s response to this process must embody the goal of an orderly and rapid transition.
"Proposals for some sort of “partnership for transformation,” based on political reform and full respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms, should bear in mind that the region’s political landscape looks certain to remain volatile and tense in the coming months."
"No surprise, then, that regional stability has emerged as a high priority for Europeans."
"Chaos, a resurgence of terrorism, the rise of radical Islamism, and massive waves of immigration towards Europe are just a few of the potential threats to the European Union that are now being contemplated."
"Given this, the EU should be doing its utmost to prevent any deterioration of the region’s security."
"Just as the post-1945 Marshall Plan consisted of a financial-aid package aimed at reconstructing and re-launching Western Europe’s economies to support democratic transformation and political stability, the countries of the Arab Spring face similar challenges and needs."
We need to enable countries like Egypt and Tunisia – and possibly a peaceful Libya – to strengthen their political stability through democratization.
The Marshall Plan was accompanied by partnerships for reconstruction in which the US and European recipient countries were on an equal footing.
The aim was to strengthen cooperation as a means of creating a lasting peace.
The situation in the Mediterranean region is at a more advanced stage.
"The broad planks of a partnership are already there, so what is now needed is to enhance Europe’s integration with its southern neighbors."
This is why Italy has proposed a new EU “Plan for the Mediterranean” aimed at supporting the transition process and building upon existing institutional and financial tools to provide the region with additional resources.
"The Union for the Mediterranean, launched by French President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008, must be revitalized and re-directed towards development projects ranging from highways and ports to the promotion of small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs)."
But a broader economic initiative is also needed to mobilize a critical mass of European and international financial resources to attract investment to the region and modernize its infrastructures and services.
"Let us, together with the US, tear down the trade and economic barriers that are stifling these economies."
Let us also grant some Mediterranean countries association status that will allow them to integrate progressively into the EU’s internal market and participate in EU programs.
"To achieve all of this, a clear set of principles is required."
"We Europeans must favor stability, create a real spirit of co-ownership, and promote political responsibility.In this new framework, the EU should avoid excessive conditionality, especially during the transition period."
"Europe’s strong support for the region’s economic development must remain the top priority, as Arab countries introduce necessary reforms."
"Moreover, a dedicated financial institution should be set up to aid in this task."
"One proposal worth considering is to upgrade and strengthen the European Investment Bank’s Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP), which would become an autonomous institution, perhaps headquartered in the Middle East or North Africa, with shares held by the region’s governments (or other institutions) and other willing parties."
"The London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development could join this effort by extending its activities to the region, which could be coupled with the creation of dedicated services to support the growth of job-creating enterprises."
The EBRD made an important contribution to the economic transition process in Eastern Europe; there’s a good case for drawing on its experience and expertise to help the southern Mediterranean.
"At the same time, the EU must launch a “dialogue among equals” on political and security matters, aimed at confidence-building across the region."
A Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean and the Middle East (CSCM) could quickly become a useful instrument for promoting this comprehensive approach to security and development.
"In short, we need to transform the Mediterranean countries into producers rather than consumers of regional stability."
We Europeans cannot afford to turn our backs on our Arab friends along the far shores of “mare nostrum.”
"They are part of our collective history, and they deserve the better future that we can help them to build."
America and Europe Divided Over Saddam
Talk is growing of a change in US defense doctrine to allow for pre-emptive strikes on states that harbor weapons of mass destruction.
"That talk is sending shudders across Europe, where many people connect it with America's oft-stated desire to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq."
"Ever since the Gulf war, Iraq has been a source of friction among the western permanent members of the UN Security Council."
"By the end of 1999, divergence was complete: the United States and Britain were employing their air power to enforce the no-fly zones while France joined Russia and China in abstaining on resolution 1284."
"As this UK-sponsored resolution was meant to bring the Iraq issue back to the Security Council after the withdrawal of the UN weapons inspectors and subsequent American air strikes of December 1998, hope for progress on Iraq within the Security Council was scant."
This rapidly changed after last September 11 th .
"On May 14, 2002, the Security Council gave the tottering sanctions regime a new lease on life by unanimously adopting a simplified screening procedure."
Even Iraq showed signs of being prepared to consider a possible return of the UN weapons inspectors.
At first sight this seems to bode well for the transatlantic relationship.
"In reality, the current relaxation is more likely a lull before the storm."
"Most Europeans take it for granted that the US will attack Iraq, and that this act of unilateralism, coming in the wake of all the other irritants such as the ABM Treaty, the Kyoto Agreement, the steel tariffs and the International Criminal Court, will have a devastating effect on transatlantic relations."
Europe would be ill-advised to become mesmerized by this approaching disaster.
"Everyone understands that the Iraqi government's improved attitude is caused by the Bush administration's sabre-rattling, but no one can tell whether this is a prelude to an inevitable war or a stratagem to make Iraq cooperate with UN weapons inspectors."
"Obviously, the US cannot remove this uncertainty without robbing the sabre-rattling of its beneficial effect."
"Given this ambiguity, there remains time for Europe to engage the US in a serious discussion of the options for dealing with Saddam."
The common aim should be to remove the threat posed by a dictator with so well-documented a predilection for weapons of mass destruction.
The options vary from resumed inspections to `regime change'.
There are arguments which make the choice far less clear-cut than it may seem.
Several of these are also being advanced within the Bush administration.
Europe can constructively participate in such discussion provided it first clears the way by:
1. ridding itself of its constant
"2. showing some understanding for the view of some in the Bush administration that the US should not be bogged down by a continent that is soft, decadent and moralizing."
"This is not a pleasant way of putting it, but many Americans remember how on two occasions in the former Yugoslavia - a pre-eminently European theatre - Europe was helpless until American warplanes showed up;"
3. making clear that Europe and the US are
This debate about how to deal with Saddam might go as follows.
"It is not difficult to overthrow Saddam, but it is impossible to predict who or what will take his place."
"Iraq may even disintegrate, leaving us with a much stronger Iran, also a member of the"
"Moreover, Saddam may already possess a weapon of mass destruction but has been deterred from using it."
"Once he is attacked by the US, he may use it against Israel, which will retaliate."
So it may well be wiser to induce Iraq to readmit the UN weapons inspectors and make sure they can do their job.
This will not entirely remove the Iraqi threat but will make it controllable.
"Should this be the outcome, European governments would breathe a sigh of relief."
But the debate may also go the other way.
"Saddam will cooperate with UN inspectors only as long as the American threat remains, and the US may conclude that it cannot afford that."
"If President Bush then opts for regime change, Europe should not opt out."
This is easier said than done.
Many Europeans will argue that they cannot condone military action without a Security Council mandate.
"But they already did, twice."
"They condoned or even supported American air strikes against Baghdad in December 1998, and they supported or even participated in NATO's air strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in March 1999."
"True, some will say, but that was under the Clinton administration."
"If Europe conveys the impression that its friendship with America depends on who wins the US presidential elections, it is likely to freeze the transatlantic relationship for years."
That hardly seems a rational policy for a continent in profound transition.
America and Europe
"Deeply frustrated by the Bush administration’s policies, many people and governments in Europe hope for a fundamental change in American foreign policy after the upcoming presidential election."
"But it would take a medium-sized political miracle for these hopes not to be disappointed, and such a miracle will not happen – whoever is elected."
The Bush administration made numerous foreign-policy blunders with far-reaching consequences.
But Bush neither invented American unilateralism nor triggered the transatlantic rift between the United States and Europe.
"To be sure, Bush reinforced both trends, but their real causes lie in objective historical factors, namely America’s being the sole world power since 1989 and Europe’s self-inflicted weakness."
"As long as America remains the sole world power, the next US President will be neither able nor willing to change the basic framework of America’s foreign policy."
"It will, of course, be important who wins the presidency: a candidate expected to continue Bush’s foreign policy or someone ready for a new beginning."
"In the former case, the transatlantic rift will deepen dramatically."
"Four, or even eight, more years of US policy à la Bush would inflict such damage on the substance of the transatlantic alliance as to threaten its very existence."
