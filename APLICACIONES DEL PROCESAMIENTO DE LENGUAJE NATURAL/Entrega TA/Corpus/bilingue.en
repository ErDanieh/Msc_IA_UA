"$10,000 Gold?"
SAN FRANCISCO – It has never been easy to have a rational conversation about the value of gold.
"Lately, with gold prices up more than 300% over the last decade, it is harder than ever."
"Just last December, fellow economists Martin Feldstein and Nouriel Roubini each penned op-eds bravely questioning bullish market sentiment, sensibly pointing out gold’s risks."
Wouldn’t you know it?
"Since their articles appeared, the price of gold has moved up still further."
"Gold prices even hit a record-high $1,300 recently."
"Last December, many gold bugs were arguing that the price was inevitably headed for $2,000."
"Now, emboldened by continuing appreciation, some are suggesting that gold could be headed even higher than that."
"One successful gold investor recently explained to me that stock prices languished for a more than a decade before the Dow Jones index crossed the 1,000 mark in the early 1980’s."
"Since then, the index has climbed above 10,000."
"Now that gold has crossed the magic $1,000 barrier, why can’t it increase ten-fold, too?"
"Admittedly, getting to a much higher price for gold is not quite the leap of imagination that it seems."
"After adjusting for inflation, today’s price is nowhere near the all-time high of January 1980."
"Back then, gold hit $850, or well over $2,000 in today’s dollars."
But January 1980 was arguably a “freak peak” during a period of heightened geo-political instability.
"At $1,300, today’s price is probably more than double very long-term, inflation-adjusted, average gold prices."
So what could justify another huge increase in gold prices from here?
"One answer, of course, is a complete collapse of the US dollar."
"With soaring deficits, and a rudderless fiscal policy, one does wonder whether a populist administration might recklessly turn to the printing press."
"And if you are really worried about that, gold might indeed be the most reliable hedge."
"Sure, some might argue that inflation-indexed bonds offer a better and more direct inflation hedge than gold."
But gold bugs are right to worry about whether the government will honor its commitments under more extreme circumstances.
"In fact, as Carmen Reinhart and I discuss in our recent book on the history of financial crises, This Time is Different, cash-strapped governments will often forcibly convert indexed debt to non-indexed debt, precisely so that its value might be inflated away."
Even the United States abrogated indexation clauses in bond contracts during the Great Depression of the 1930’s.
So it can happen anywhere.
"Even so, the fact that very high inflation is possible does not make it probable, so one should be cautious in arguing that higher gold prices are being driven by inflation expectations."
Some have argued instead that gold’s long upward march has been partly driven by the development of new financial instruments that make it easier to trade and speculate in gold.
There is probably some slight truth – and also a certain degree of irony – to this argument.
"After all, medieval alchemists engaged in what we now consider an absurd search for ways to transform base metals into gold."
"Wouldn’t it be paradoxical, then, if financial alchemy could make an ingot of gold worth dramatically more?"
"In my view, the most powerful argument to justify today’s high price of gold is the dramatic emergence of Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East into the global economy."
"As legions of new consumers gain purchasing power, demand inevitably rises, driving up the price of scarce commodities."
"At the same time, emerging-market central banks need to accumulate gold reserves, which they still hold in far lower proportion than do rich-country central banks."
"With the euro looking less appetizing as a diversification play away from the dollar, gold’s appeal has naturally grown."
"So, yes, there are solid fundamentals that arguably support today’s higher gold price, although it is far more debatable whether and to what extent they will continue to support higher prices in the future."
"Indeed, another critical fundamental factor that has been sustaining high gold prices might prove far more ephemeral than globalization."
Gold prices are extremely sensitive to global interest-rate movements.
"After all, gold pays no interest and even costs something to store."
"Today, with interest rates near or at record lows in many countries, it is relatively cheap to speculate in gold instead of investing in bonds."
"But if real interest rates rise significantly, as well they might someday, gold prices could plummet."
"Most economic research suggests that gold prices are very difficult to predict over the short to medium term, with the odds of gains and losses being roughly in balance."
It is therefore dangerous to extrapolate from short-term trends.
"Yes, gold has had a great run, but so, too, did worldwide housing prices until a couple of years ago."
"If you are a high-net-worth investor, a sovereign wealth fund, or a central bank, it makes perfect sense to hold a modest proportion of your portfolio in gold as a hedge against extreme events."
"But, despite gold’s heightened allure in the wake of an extraordinary run-up in its price, it remains a very risky bet for most of us."
"Of course, such considerations might have little influence on prices."
What was true for the alchemists of yore remains true today: gold and reason are often difficult to reconcile.
1929 or 1989?
"PARIS – As the economic crisis deepens and widens, the world has been searching for historical analogies to help us understand what has been happening."
"At the start of the crisis, many people likened it to 1982 or 1973, which was reassuring, because both dates refer to classical cyclical downturns."
"Today, the mood is much grimmer, with references to 1929 and 1931 beginning to abound, even if some governments continue to behave as if the crisis was more classical than exceptional."
The tendency is either excessive restraint (Europe) or a diffusion of the effort (the United States).
"Europe is being cautious in the name of avoiding debt and defending the euro, whereas the US has moved on many fronts in order not to waste an ideal opportunity to implement badly needed structural reforms."
"For geo-strategists, however, the year that naturally comes to mind, in both politics and economics, is 1989."
"Of course, the fall of the house of Lehman Brothers has nothing to do with the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"Indeed, on the surface it seems to be its perfect antithesis: the collapse of a wall symbolizing oppression and artificial divisions versus the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and reassuring institution of financial capitalism."
"Yet 2008-2009, like 1989, may very well correspond to an epochal change, whose unfolding consequences will be felt for decades."
The end of the East-West ideological divide and the end of absolute faith in markets are historical turning points.
"And what happens in 2009 may jeopardize some of the positive results of 1989, including the peaceful reunification of Europe and the triumph of democratic principles over nationalist, if not xenophobic, tendencies."
"In 1989, liberal democracy triumphed over the socialist ideology incarnated and promoted by the Soviet Bloc."
"For many of his supporters, it was President Ronald Reagan who, with his deliberate escalation of the arms race, pushed the Soviet economy to the brink, thereby fully demonstrating the superiority of liberal societies and free markets."
"Of course, there are obvious differences between 1989 and now."
"First, and perhaps above all, the revolutions of 1989 and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union put an end to global bipolarity."
"By contrast, 2009 is likely to pave the way to a new form of bipolarity, but with China substituting for the Soviet Union."
"Second, whereas democracy and market capitalism appeared as clear – if more fragile than expected – winners in 1989, it is difficult in 2009, with the spread of the global crisis, to distinguish winners from losers."
"Everyone seems to be a loser, even if some are more affected than others."
"Yet, history is unfair, and the US, despite its greater responsibility for today’s global crisis, may emerge in better shape than most countries from the morass. In better shape, but not alone."
"As a visiting professor at Harvard and MIT, I am getting a good preview of what the world could look like when the crisis finally passes."
One senses something like the making of an American-Asian dominated universe.
"From the incredible media lab at MIT to the mathematics and economics departments at Harvard, Asians – Chinese and Indians, in particular – are everywhere, like the Romans in Athens in the first century BC: full of admiration for those from whom they were learning so much, and whom they would overcome in the coming decades."
"But before this new order appears, the world may be faced with spreading disorder, if not outright chaos."
"What, for example, will happen to a country as central and vulnerable as Egypt when hundred of thousands of Egyptians working in the Gulf are forced to return to their homeland as a result of the crisis in the oil-producing countries?"
"When the rich get less rich, the poor get poorer."
And what about the foreign workers who have reached for the “European dream” and are now faced with potential explosions of xenophobia in Europe’s supposedly open countries?
"The consequences of 1989 ended up being less enduring than many observers, including me, would have assumed."
"We can only hope that, in the end, the consequences of 2009 similarly prove to be far less dramatic than we now – intuitively and in our historical reflexes – feel them to be."
The End of 1945
"NEW YORK – On May 8, 1945, when World War II in Europe officially ended, much of the world lay in ruins. But if the human capacity for destruction knows few limits, the ability to start over again is just as remarkable."
Perhaps that is why mankind has so far managed to survive.
"No doubt, millions of people at the end of the war were too hungry and exhausted to do anything much beyond staying alive. But, at the same time, a wave of idealism swept across the wreckage, a collective sense of determination to build a more equal, peaceful, and safer world."
"That is why the war’s great hero, Winston Churchill, was voted out of office in the summer of 1945, even before Japan surrendered."
Men and women had not risked their lives simply to return to the old days of class privilege and social deprivation.
"They wanted better housing, education, and free health care for all."
"Similar demands were heard all over Europe, where the anti-Nazi or anti-fascist resistance was often led by leftists, or indeed Communists, and prewar conservatives were frequently tainted by collaboration with fascist regimes."
"There was talk of revolution in countries such as France, Italy, and Greece."
"This did not happen, because neither the Western Allies nor the Soviet Union supported it."
Stalin was content to settle for an empire in Eastern Europe.
"But even Charles de Gaulle, a resistance leader of the right, had to accept Communists in his first postwar government, and he agreed to nationalize industries and banks."
"The swing to the left, to social-democratic welfare states, occurred all over Western Europe."
It was part of the 1945 consensus.
"A different kind of revolution was taking place in Europe’s former colonies in Asia, where native peoples had no desire to be ruled once more by Western powers, which had been so ignominiously defeated by Japan."
"Vietnamese, Indonesians, Filipinos, Burmese, Indians, and Malays wanted their freedom, too."
"These aspirations were often voiced in the United Nations, founded in 1945."
"The UN, like the dream of European unity, was also part of the 1945 consensus."
"For a short while, many prominent people – Albert Einstein, for one – believed that only a world government would be able to ensure global peace."
"This dream quickly faded when the Cold War divided the world into two hostile blocs. But in some ways the 1945 consensus, in the West, was strengthened by Cold War politics."
"Communism, still wrapped in the laurel leaf of anti-fascism, had a wide intellectual and emotional appeal, not only in the so-called Third World, but also in Western Europe."
"Social democracy, with its promise of greater equality and opportunities for all, served as an ideological antidote."
Most social democrats were in fact fiercely anti-communist.
"Today, 70 years later, much of the 1945 consensus no longer survives. Few people can muster great enthusiasm for the UN."
The European dream is in crisis. And the post-war social-democratic welfare state is being eroded more and more every day.
"The rot began during the 1980s, under Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher."
Neoliberals attacked the expense of entitlement programs and the vested interests of trade unions.
"Citizens, it was thought, had to become more self-reliant; government welfare programs were making everyone soft and dependent."
"In Thatcher’s famous words, there was no such thing as “society,” only families and individuals who ought to be taking care of themselves."
"But the 1945 consensus was dealt a much greater blow precisely when we all rejoiced at the collapse of the Soviet Empire, the other great twentieth-century tyranny."
"In 1989, it looked as if the dark legacy of World War II, the enslavement of Eastern Europe, was finally over. And in many ways, it was."
But much else collapsed with the Soviet model. Social democracy lost its raison d’être as an antidote to Communism.
"All forms of leftist ideology – indeed, everything that smacked of collective idealism – came to be viewed as misguided utopianism that could lead only to the Gulag."
"Neoliberalism filled the vacuum, creating vast wealth for some people, but at the expense of the ideal of equality that had emerged from World War II."
The extraordinary reception of Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century shows how keenly the consequences of the collapse of the left have been felt.
"In recent years, other ideologies have also emerged to fill the human need for collective ideals."
"The rise of right-wing populism reflects revived yearnings for pure national communities that keep immigrants and minorities out. And, perversely, American neo-conservatives have transformed the internationalism of the old left by seeking to impose a democratic world order by US military force."
The answer to these alarming developments is not nostalgia.
We cannot simply return to the past.
"Too much has changed. But a new aspiration toward social and economic equality, and international solidarity, is badly needed."
"It cannot be the same as the 1945 consensus, but we would do well, on this anniversary, to remember why that consensus was forged in the first place."
What Failed in 2008?
"BERKELEY – To solve a problem, it is not enough to know what to do."
You actually have to implement the solution – and be willing to change course if it turns out that you did not know quite as much as you thought.
"That is the message of two recent books that, together, tell you everything you need to know about the 2008 financial crisis: what caused it, what can be done to prevent it from recurring, and why those things have yet to be done."
"The first book is The Shifts and the Shocks, by the conservative British journalist Martin Wolf, who begins by cataloguing the major shifts that set the stage for the economic disaster that continues to shape the world today."
"His starting point is the huge rise in wealth among the world’s richest 0.1% and 0.01% and the consequent pressure for people, governments, and companies to take on increasingly unsustainable levels of debt."
"Meanwhile, policymakers were lulled into complacency by the widespread acceptance of economic theories such as the “efficient-market hypothesis,” which assumes that investors act rationally and use all available information when making their decisions."
"As a result, markets were deregulated, making it easier to trade assets that were perceived to be safe, but were in fact not."
"As a result, systemic risk proliferated beyond central bankers’ wildest imagination."
Untested – and ultimately incorrect – assumptions created a policymaking environment defined by what can only be called hubris.
Officials underestimated tail risks.
"They set inflation targets at around 2% – leaving little room for maneuver when the water got choppy. And, most audaciously of all, the European Union introduced the euro as a common currency."
"Indeed, wrongheaded policymaking continued long after the crisis began."
"Politicians responded to worsening economic conditions by hewing as closely as possible to failed prescriptions, making sure to do no more than absolutely necessary to address the biggest economic disaster since the Great Depression."
"Wolf’s prescription for countering the crisis is simple, smart, and unassailable."
"In the short term, he suggests that countries with reserve currencies spend more (especially to finance public-sector investments) and issue more debt."
"Their central banks, he argues, should raise inflation targets to 3% or even 4% per year."
"Over the medium term, according to Wolf, countries need to put in place regulatory measures that lower debt levels and discourage overleveraging."
"The eurozone, too, must resolve its internal contradictions, either by disbanding or by introducing “a minimum set of institutions and policies” that allow the monetary union to function properly."
"Wolf’s long-term solutions include tackling inequality, “more global regulation,” a greater degree of “freedom for individual countries to craft their own responses,” and economic analysis that is less in thrall to the free-market ideologues that led us into the crisis in the first place."
"And yet, as recommendable as Wolf’s proposals may be, little has been done to implement them."
"The reasons why are found in the second book: Hall of Mirrors, by&nbsp;my friend, teacher, and patron, Barry Eichengreen."
"Eichengreen traces our tepid response to the crisis to the triumph of monetarist economists, the disciples of Milton Friedman, over their Keynesian and Minskyite peers – at least when it comes to interpretations of the causes and consequences of the Great Depression."
"When the 2008 financial crisis erupted, policymakers tried to apply Friedman’s proposed solutions to the Great Depression."
"Unfortunately, this turned out to be the wrong thing to do, as the monetarist interpretation of the Great Depression was, to put it bluntly, wrong in significant respects and radically incomplete."
"The resulting policies were enough to prevent the post-2008 recession from developing into a full-blown depression; but that partial success turned out to be a Pyrrhic victory, for it allowed politicians to declare that the crisis had been overcome, and that it was time to embrace austerity and focus on structural reform."
"The result is today’s stagnant economy, marked by anemic growth that threatens to become the new normal."
"The United States and Europe are on track to have thrown away 10% of their potential wealth, while the failure to strengthen financial-sector regulation has left the world economy exposed to the risk of another major crisis."
Wolf and Eichengreen would agree that the main shortcomings that led to the 2008 financial crisis – and that continue to underpin our inadequate response to it – are intellectual.
"Indeed, the only true lesson of the crisis so far seems to be that its lessons will never truly be learned."
2011: My Space Odyssey
"MOSCOW – Most people who know of me think of me as an information-technology expert, someone who probably lives in California and invests in edgy Internet start-ups."
"In fact, my formal residence is in New York City, but I am about to spend most of the next five months in Russia, training to be a cosmonaut in Star City, just outside Moscow."
It all came about in a number of ways.
"First of all, as a kid, I just assumed that I would go to the moon, without having to do much in particular to make it happen."
"I just took it for granted that, by the time I was, say, 40, space travel would be a common thing."
"My father was involved with the United States space program, and we had some moon rocks at home, so I thought it was no big deal."
Then I got distracted for about 40 years.
"A few years ago, however, I started paying attention to space again."
"A lot of people I knew in the IT industry were doing the same: Elon Musk, a co-founder of PayPal, founded Space-X;"
Jeff Bezos of Amazon started a spacecraft company called Blue Origin;
"Jeff Greason, a senior manager at Intel, started XCOR Aerospace (in which I’m an investor)."
"In 2005, the last year I held my PC Forum conference for IT entrepreneurs, I started a conference called Flight School for entrepreneurs in space and private aviation."
"Meanwhile, in about 2005, I was in South Africa with a small group advising former President Thabo Mbeki and his government about its IT policy."
"One of the group was Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Thawte (sold to VeriSign), who had recently come back from a trip to the space station as the second “space tourist.”"
"One evening, the group sat around a campfire as the sun set, and around 50 African schoolchildren were bussed in."
"Altogether, there were about 100 of us, President Mbeki included, around a roaring fire."
"Once it was dark, a screen was set up and Mark showed home videos from space."
"He gave a fascinating talk about his adventures, complete with clips of him floating around, catching bubbles in his mouth, and so on."
"The kids loved it, and I'm sure some of them decided then and there to study math and science."
"Eventually, I invested in Space Adventures, the company that organized Shuttleworth’s trip into space."
"Later, I went on a tour that they organized to watch the launch of Charles Simonyi, the fifth (and soon seventh) space tourist, from Baikonur in Kazakhstan. (Simonyi wrote the Microsoft Word program, and now has another start-up, Intentional Software, and a foundation, as well as a Web site, CharlesinSpace.org.)"
"Soon after, I started casually discussing the notion of becoming a backup cosmonaut with the Space Adventures team."
"Yes, I would love to actually go, but the trip to space costs $35 to $40 million, whereas backup training costs “only” $3 million."
So I had vague thoughts that I might go into space sometime in 2011 - the year that Google co-founder Sergey Brin is (very) tentatively slated to go.
"Space Adventures was pushing for 2009, but I was pretty busy."
Then something happened last spring: my sister Emily discovered that she had cancer and had a double mastectomy.
"(She is doing well now and, in fact, just won a mini-marathon.)"
"A couple of weeks later, I was faced with one of those conflicts: a board meeting here, a conference there, another opportunity at the same time somewhere else."
"“Aaagh,” I thought, “if only I had a double mastectomy: I could cancel all these things and no one would complain!”"
"Good grief! I realized my priorities were all out of whack.   So in some odd way, this sabbatical in Russia is my alternative to a double mastectomy – a positive one, to be sure, but the same kind of reset-button experience."
"It is also the answer to another question I hear a lot because of my work on human genetics through 23andMe (www.23andme.com) and the Personal Genome Project (www.personalgenome.org): If you learned you had a high chance of developing Alzheimer’s in a few years, what would you do?"
"Why, I’d go train to be a cosmonaut, of course! And why wait to find out I may get Alzheimer’s? Next month, I will write about what training to go into space actually involves."
9/11 and the New Authoritarianism
"Five years after the attacks on the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, “9/11” is no longer a mere date."
"It has entered the history books as the beginning of something new, a new era perhaps, but in any case a time of change."
"The terrorist bombings in Madrid and London and elsewhere will also be remembered; but it is “9/11” that has become the catchphrase, almost like “August 1914.”"
"But was it really a war that started on September 11, 2001?"
Not all are happy about this American notion.
"During the heyday of Irish terrorism in the UK, successive British governments went out of their way not to concede to the IRA the notion that a war was being waged."
"“War” would have meant acceptance of the terrorists as legitimate enemies, in a sense as equals in a bloody contest for which there are accepted rules of engagement."
"This is neither a correct description nor a useful terminology for terrorist acts, which are more correctly described as criminal."
"By calling them war – and naming an opponent, usually al-Qaeda and its leader, Osama bin Laden – the United States government has justified domestic changes that, before the 9/11 attacks, would have been unacceptable in any free country."
Most of these changes were embodied in the so-called “USA Patriot Act.”
"Though some of the changes simply involved administrative regulations, the Patriot Act’s overall effect was to erode the great pillars of liberty, such as habeas corpus , the right to recourse to an independent court whenever the state deprives an individual of his freedom."
"From an early date, the prison camp at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba became the symbol of something unheard of: the arrest without trial of “illegal combatants” who are deprived of all human rights."
The world now wonders how many more of these non-human humans are there in how many places.
"For everyone else, a kind of state of emergency was proclaimed that has allowed state interference in essential civil rights."
"Controls at borders have become an ordeal for many, and police persecution now burdens quite a few."
"A climate of fear has made life hard for anyone who looks suspicious or acts suspiciously, notably for Muslims."
Such restrictions on freedom did not meet with much public opposition when they were adopted.
"On the contrary, by and large it was the critics, not the supporters, of these measures who found themselves in trouble."
"In Britain, where Prime Minister Tony Blair supported the US attitude entirely, the government introduced similar measures and even offered a new theory."
Blair was the first to argue that security is the first freedom.
"In other words, liberty is not the right of individuals to define their own lives, but the right of the state to restrict individual freedom in the name of a security that only the state can define."
This is the beginning of a new authoritarianism.
"The problem exists in all countries affected by the threat of terrorism, though in many it has not become quite as specific."
"In most countries of continental Europe, “9/11” has remained an American date."
There is even a debate – and indeed some evidence – concerning the question of whether involvement in the “war against terrorism” has actually increased the threat of terrorist acts.
Germans certainly use this argument to stay out of the action wherever possible.
"This stance, however, has not prevented the spread of something for which a German word is used in other languages, too: Angst ."
A diffuse anxiety is gaining ground.
"People feel uneasy and worried, especially when traveling."
Any train accident or airplane crash is now at first suspected of being an act of terrorism.
"Thus, 9/11 has meant, directly or indirectly, a great shock, both psychologically and to our political systems."
"While terrorism is fought in the name of democracy, the fight has in fact led to a distinct weakening of democracy, owing to official legislation and popular angst."
One of the worrying features of the 9/11 attacks is that it is hard to see their purpose beyond the perpetrators’ resentment of the West and its ways.
"But the West’s key features, democracy and the rule of law, have taken a far more severe battering at the hands of their defenders than by their attackers."
"Two steps, above all, are needed to restore confidence in liberty within the democracies affected by the legacy of 9/11."
"First, we must make certain that the relevant legislation to meet the challenge of terrorism is strictly temporary."
Some of today’s restrictions on habeas corpus and civil liberties have sunset clauses restricting their validity; all such rules should be re-examined by parliaments regularly.
"Second, and more importantly, our leaders must seek to calm, rather than exploit, public anxiety."
"The terrorists with whom we are currently at “war” cannot win, because their dark vision will never gain broad popular legitimacy."
That is all the more reason for democrats to stand tall in defending our values – first and foremost by acting in accordance with them.
9/11 in Perspective
"NEW YORK – It was a decade ago that 19 terrorists took control of four planes, flew two into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, hit the Pentagon with a third, and crashed the fourth in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers resisted and made it impossible for the terrorists to complete their malevolent mission. In a matter of hours, more than 3,000 innocent people, mostly Americans, but also people from 115 other countries, had their lives suddenly and violently taken from them."
"September 11, 2001, was a terrible tragedy by any measure, but it was not a historical turning point."
"It did not herald a new era of international relations in which terrorists with a global agenda prevailed, or in which such spectacular terrorist attacks became commonplace."
"On the contrary, 9/11 has not been replicated."
"Despite the attention devoted to the “Global War on Terrorism,” the most important developments of the last ten years have been the introduction and spread of innovative information technologies, globalization, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the political upheavals in the Middle East."
"As for the future, it is much more likely to be defined by the United States’ need to put its economic house in order; China’s trajectory within and beyond its borders; and the ability of the world’s governments to cooperate on restoring economic growth, stemming the spread of nuclear weapons, and meeting energy and environmental challenges."
It is and would be wrong to make opposition to terrorism the centerpiece of what responsible governments do in the world.
Terrorists continue to be outliers with limited appeal at best.
They can destroy but not create.
It is worth noting that the people who went into the streets of Cairo and Damascus calling for change were not shouting the slogans of Al Qaeda or supporting its agenda.
"Moreover, measures have been implemented to push back, successfully, against terrorists."
Intelligence assets have been redirected.
Borders have been made more secure and societies more resilient.
"International cooperation has increased markedly, in part because governments that cannot agree on many things can agree on the need to cooperate in this area."
Military force has played a role as well.
Al Qaeda lost its base in Afghanistan when the Taliban government that had provided it sanctuary was ousted from power.
Osama bin-Laden was finally found and killed by US Special Forces in the suburbs of Islamabad.
"Drones – unmanned aircraft that are remotely steered – have proven to be effective in killing a significant number of terrorists, including many of the most important leaders."
Weak governments can be made stronger; governments that tolerate or support terrorism must be held accountable.
But progress is not to be confused with victory.
Terrorists and terrorism cannot be eliminated any more than we can rid the world of disease.
"There will always be those who will resort to force against innocent men, women, and children in pursuit of political goals."
"Indeed, terrorists are advancing in some areas."
Pakistan remains a sanctuary for Al Qaeda and some of the world’s other most dangerous terrorists.
"A mixture of instability, government weakness, and ideology in countries such as Yemen, Libya, Somalia, and Nigeria are providing fertile territory for terrorists to organize, train, and mount operations – much as they did in Afghanistan did a decade ago."
New groups constantly emerge from the ruins of old ones.
There is also a growing danger of homegrown terrorism.
We have seen it in Great Britain and the US.
"The Internet, one of the great inventions of the modern Western world, has shown itself to be a weapon that can be used to incite and train those who wish to cause harm to that world."
"The question raised in October 2003 by then US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is no less relevant today: “Are we capturing, killing, or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting, training, and deploying against us?”"
"All things being equal, we probably are."
"But even small terrorist successes are costly in terms of lives, money, and making open societies less so."
What is to be done?
"Alas, there is no single or silver bullet."
"The establishment of a Palestinian state will not be enough for those terrorists who want to see the elimination of the Jewish state, any more than reaching a compromise over Kashmir will satisfy those Pakistan-based terrorists with bigger agendas vis-à-vis India."
"Reducing unemployment is desirable, of course, but many terrorists do not come from poverty."
"Helping to make societies in the Middle East and elsewhere more democratic might reduce the alienation that can lead to radicalism and worse, but this is easier said than done."
"Of course, we want to continue to find ways to make ourselves less vulnerable and terrorists more so."
"But what may be most important, particularly in the Arab and Islamic communities, is to end any acceptance of terrorism."
The Nigerian father who warned the US embassy in Lagos that he feared what his own son might do – before that same young man attempted to detonate a bomb aboard a flight to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 – is an example of just this.
"Only when more parents, teachers, and community leaders behave likewise will recruitment of terrorists dry up and law-enforcement authorities receive full cooperation from the populations they police."
Terrorism must lose its legitimacy among those who have historically supported or tolerated it before it will lose its potency.
Transatlantic Trade for All
"WASHINGTON, DC – The negotiations to create a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the European Union and the United States are being widely welcomed."
"British Prime Minister David Cameron has called the TTIP a “once-in-a-generation prize,” citing potential gains of £80 billion ($125.5 billion) each for the EU and the US and £85 billion for the rest of the world."
"For a world weary of waiting for the World Trade Organization’s interminable Doha trade round to conclude, even a bilateral trade initiative may seem like a boon, especially when, as a recent Financial Times editorial pointed out, “bilateral” covers half of the world’s economy."
"But there is a serious downside: The deal could hurt developing-country exporters, unless the EU and the US make a concerted effort to protect these actors’ interests."
The feature of the proposed pact that elicits the most excitement – its focus on regulatory barriers like mandatory product standards – should actually incite the greatest concern.
"Given low tariffs in the EU and the US – less than 5%, on average – further preferential reductions will not seriously handicap outsiders."
"But, when it comes to standards – such as those governing safety, health, and the environment – the market-access requirements are brutal and binary: either you meet the established standard or you do not sell."
"As a result, third-country firms’ options will depend on how TTIP standards are established: through harmonization (adoption of a common standard) or mutual recognition (acceptance of goods that meet one another’s established standards)."
The first option would enable producers everywhere to take advantage of economies of scale.
"But, in some cases, the harmonized standard could be more stringent than some countries’ original standards."
"Even though new standards would apply to suppliers from all exporting countries, compliance costs usually vary, meaning that those less equipped to meet higher standards could suffer."
"In the late 1990’s, when the EU decided to harmonize standards for aflatoxins (a group of toxic compounds produced by certain molds), eight member states – including Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain – raised their national standards substantially, which is likely to have caused African exports of cereals, dried fruits, and nuts to Europe to decline by as much as $670 million."
"With mutual recognition, the EU and the US would accept each other’s standards or conformity-assessment procedures, allowing firms to adhere to the less stringent requirements in each area."
"If the policy were extended to third-country firms, it would have a powerful liberalizing impact."
"For example, Malaysian television producers could choose to comply with, say, America’s easier-to-meet safety standards, then sell the same product in both markets, reaping the benefits of economies of scale while lowering compliance costs."
"If, however, the TTIP excluded third-country firms from the mutual recognition policy, their competitiveness vis-à-vis European and American companies would diminish substantially."
"Indeed, our research shows that when mutual-recognition agreements include restrictive rules of origin, intra-regional trade increases – at the expense of trade with other countries – and that developing countries tend to suffer most."
"In fact, excessively constraining rules of origin have proved problematic for some of the EU’s previous recognition agreements, such as those governing professional-services standards."
"While a Brazilian orange admitted for sale in Portugal can be sold throughout the EU, a Brazilian engineer or accountant licensed in Portugal must fulfill separate licensing requirements to work elsewhere in the EU, hampering much-needed labor mobility by forcing non-European workers to endure costly and inefficient bureaucratic procedures."
"Furthermore, when it comes to tariffs and standards, WTO rules are not created equal."
"While they protect countries excluded from bilateral or regional tariff agreements, thereby ensuring that integrated markets do not receive additional advantages, few safeguards exist to shield third countries from the fallout of agreements on mandatory standards."
"Even in the absence of international rules, the EU and the US could take two actions to ensure that the TTIP does not have adverse consequences for developing economies."
"First, they could allow all countries to reap the benefits of a bilateral mutual-recognition deal by agreeing not to impose restrictive rules of origin."
"Second, where they do consider harmonization, they could favor the less stringent of the original standards, unless there is credible evidence that it would not support the relevant regulatory objective."
This is akin to a WTO test for departures from established international standards.
"If the EU and the US made these two commitments, the rest of the world could follow the TTIP negotiations with hope, rather than trepidation."
A Bad Deal for America’s Future
"WASHINGTON, DC – The painfully negotiated US budget legislation that President Barack Obama signed on August 2 combines an increase in America’s government debt ceiling with reductions in federal spending, thus averting the prospect of the first default in the 224-year history of the United States."
But the agreement has three major flaws.
"Two of them offset each other, but the third threatens what America needs most in the coming years: economic growth."
"The first flaw is that the spending reductions are badly timed: coming as they do when the US economy is weak, they risk triggering another recession."
"The measure’s second shortcoming, however, is that the spending reductions that it mandates are modest."
"While the legislation does too little to address America’s problem of chronic and rising budget deficits, the damage that it inflicts on the economy in the short term is likely to be limited."
"The third and most damaging flaw, however, is that the spending cuts come in the wrong places."
"Because the Democrats in Congress have an almost religious commitment to preserving, intact, America’s principal welfare programs for senior citizens, Social Security and Medicare, the legislation does not touch either of them."
"These programs’ costs will rise sharply as the 78-million-strong baby-boom generation – those born between 1946 and 1964 – retires and collects benefits, accounting for the largest increase in government spending and prospective deficits in the years ahead."
"And, because the Republicans in Congress have an equally strong allergy to raising any taxes, any time, under any circumstances, the bill does not rely at all on tax increases – not even for the wealthiest Americans – for the deficit reduction that it provides."
"All of the spending cuts come from the “discretionary” part of the federal budget, which excludes Social Security, Medicare, the Medicaid program for the poor, and interest on the national debt."
"That leaves only about one-third of total federal spending from which to cut, and much of that goes to the defense budget, which Republicans will attempt to protect in the future."
"So the structure established by the August 2 law concentrates deficit reduction on the “discretionary non-defense” part of the federal budget, which is only about 10% of it."
This is too small a pool of money from which to achieve deficit reduction on the scale that the US will need in the years ahead.
"Worse yet, discretionary non-defense spending includes programs that are indispensable for economic growth – and economic growth is indispensable for America’s future prosperity and global standing."
"Growth is, in the first place, the best way to reduce the country’s budget deficits."
"The higher the growth rate, the more revenues the government will collect without raising tax rates; and higher revenues enable smaller deficits."
"Moreover, economic growth is necessary to keep the promise – enormously important to individual Americans – that each generation will have the opportunity to become more prosperous than the preceding one, the popular term for which is “the American dream.”"
"Just as important for non-Americans, only robust economic growth can ensure that the US sustains its expansive role in the world, which supports the global economy and contributes to stability in Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East."
"As Thomas L. Friedman and I explain in our forthcoming book That Used To Be Us: How America Fell Behind in the World It Invented and How We Can Come Back, a crucial factor in America's economic success has been an ongoing public-private partnership, which dates back to the founding of the country, that is imperiled by the pattern of budget cuts established by the August 2 legislation."
"That partnership has five components: wider opportunities for education in order to produce a workforce with cutting-edge skills; investment in infrastructure – roads, power plants, and ports – that supports commerce; funds for research and development to expand the frontiers of knowledge in ways that generate new products; an immigration policy that attracts and retains talented people from beyond America’s borders; and business regulations strong enough to prevent disasters such as the near-meltdown of the financial system in 2008 but not so stringent as to stifle the risk-taking and innovation that produce growth."
"The first three elements of the American formula for growth cost money, and that money is included in the “discretionary non-defense” part of the federal budget now targeted by the debt-ceiling legislation."
"Cutting these programs will lower American economic growth in the long term, with negative consequences both at home and abroad."
"Reducing the deficit by cutting funds for education, infrastructure, and research and development is akin to trying to lose weight by cutting off three fingers. Most of the weight will remain, and one’s life prospects will have worsened significantly."
"Reducing deficits in order to raise the debt ceiling was the right thing to do, but the August 2 law does it in the wrong way."
"Unless more deficit reduction, which is inevitable, comes from curbing entitlement benefits and increasing revenues, and less from programs vital for economic growth, the result will be a poorer, weaker US – and a more uncertain, if not unstable, world."
A Balanced Look at Sino-American Imbalance
"BEIJING – Before July 2007, most economists agreed that global imbalances were the most important threat to global growth."
"It was argued that the United States’ rising net foreign debt-to-GDP ratio – the result of chronic current-account deficits – would put a sharp brake on capital inflows, in turn weakening the dollar, driving up interest rates, and plunging the US economy into crisis."
But this scenario failed to materialize.
"Instead, the crisis stemmed from the US sub-prime debacle, which quickly dragged the global economy into its deepest recession since the 1930’s."
"Most economists failed to foresee the economic dynamics that actually led to the crisis, because they failed to pay enough attention to the rapid increase in US total debt."
"Instead, they focused exclusively on US foreign debt, ignoring household debt (mortgage and consumer debt), public debt, business debt, and financial debt."
"In particular, they should have paid greater attention to the sustainability of US mortgage and consumer debt."
"In 2007, the mortgage and consumer debt-to-GDP ratio was more than 90%, compared to 24% for net foreign debt."
"Of course, the various components of debt differ considerably in their character and sources of financing – and thus in their sustainability."
But all parts of a country’s total debt and how it is financed are interconnected.
This means two things.
"First, funds from different sources of finance are interchangeable to a certain degree: deficiency of funds for one component of total debt can be supplemented by surplus funds originally aimed at financing other components."
"Second, troubles in any single component of total debt will have an impact on all the other components."
"After the subprime crisis erupted, mortgage and consumer debt was paid down by households either with their savings or by default."
"The fall in US total debt, and the narrowing of the financing gap between total debt and domestic funds, led to a significant improvement in the US current-account deficit in 2008-2009, disproving US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke’s claim that the deficit was caused by a global “saving glut.”"
"Indeed, America’s current-account position strengthened despite the dollar’s appreciation in the face of safe-haven demand."
"Unfortunately, as a result of the private-sector deleveraging and an increase in household savings, the US economy, driven by debt and consumption, slid into recession."
"To offset the negative impact of private-sector deleveraging on growth, the US government has maintained expansionary fiscal and monetary policies."
"Now, with household debt sustained on a knife-edge after feverish government intervention, the fiscal position has deteriorated dramatically and the current-account balance has worsened again."
"Sustainability of public debt has replaced sustainability of private debt as the biggest threat to financial stability, and the focus of debate about the US current account has shifted from the sustainability of foreign debt to the impact of reducing the external deficit on growth and employment."
The dilemma facing US policymakers is how to stimulate growth while lowering the level of total debt.
The most important way to achieve both objectives is to increase exports by strengthening US competitiveness.
But where will increased competitiveness come from?
"Devaluation of the dollar could improve US competitiveness in the short run, but it is not a solution."
"Because rapid fiscal deterioration now has investors worrying about capital losses on US government securities, devaluation would make foreigners more hesitant to finance America’s budget deficit."
"If foreign financing is not forthcoming, yields on US government debt will rise and the US economy will fall back into recession."
"In the long run, America’s growth pattern must undergo a structural shift from reliance on debt and consumption one based on Americans vaunted capacity for creativity and innovation."
Only then will America improve its competitiveness enough to allow the government to reduce both private and public debt to sustainable levels while maintaining a respectable growth rate.
"But neither improved competitiveness, nor reduction of total debt, can be achieved overnight."
"In the short run, the US current-account deficit will remain, regardless of which country runs bilateral surpluses."
"Thus, China’s continued reinvestment of its current-account surplus in US government securities is of utmost important for US growth and financial stability."
"Given that America benefits mightily from China’s purchases of US government securities, it is difficult to understand why the US government and Congress have been complaining so much about the bilateral current-account deficit."
"It is also difficult to grasp why China is so reluctant to reduce its bilateral surplus, given meager returns on its massive holdings of US government securities and a sustained risk of large capital losses in the future."
"The good news is that, following President Hu Jintao’s recent visit to Washington, both America and China have been taking positive steps to resolve their differences over the bilateral current-account balance."
"That augurs well for a more rational and constructive Sino-American dialogue on global imbalances, which would certainly benefit the global economy."
Abba Eban: The Voice of Israel
"For almost two generations, Abba Eban was Israel's voice - its messenger to the high and mighty among the nations as well as to the Jewish people all over the world."
"Since he first appeared at the side of Dr. Chaim Weizmann in the late 1940's during the struggle for Jewish statehood and sovereignty, few people could articulate the Zionist and later the Israeli case with comparable eloquence and conviction."
"With his Churchillian prose and almost Shakespearean cadences, his mellifluous phrases and sonorous voice carried for decades a message of hope from a people that could have lost all hope and trust in humanity after the horrors of World War II."
"As Ambassador to the United States and the UN, and later as Foreign Minister, he represented an Israel with which the world's liberal imagination could identify."
"Larger and more powerful nations were envious of so a powerful spokesman, and his speeches became textbook models for statesmen and diplomats in distant lands."
His books - which he found time to write despite the hectic demands of diplomacy - were a unique combination of enormous erudition and crystalline clarity.
His scholarly training and rhetorical gifts supplemented each other in a rare fashion.
Rarely has a small country been represented by a statesman of such world stature: only Thomas Masaryk and Jan Smuts come to mind to compare with him.
"He was a true patriot, in the old-fashioned sense of the word: proud of his people, but never ethno-centric; a man of the world, but deeply embedded in Jewish cultural heritage; focused on the plights and tribulations of the Jewish people, but never losing the universal horizon of mankind."
"In short, he was a modern Jew in the best sense of the word."
"It was said of Prime Minister Levi Eshkol that he spoke seven languages, all of them in Yiddish."
"Of Eban it could be said that he spoke ten languages, and all of them with an Oxford/Cambridge accent."
Yet what appealed to the outside world was not always an asset in the rough and tumble of Israeli politics.
"Perhaps Eban was too urbane, too much of a scholar and gentleman to be able to make it - in Disraeli's phrase - to the top of the greasy pole."
Together with Golda Meir and Moshe Dayan he had to leave government in 1974 in the wake of the Yom Kippur War.
"He could hardly have been held responsible for the hubris which led to the avalanche of 1973, yet it nonetheless brought him down as well."
"He never found his way back, and when confronted with the New Politics of primaries and populism, he became dispirited when he could not cope with this new style."
"In the international arena, Eban's pen was his sword, and the spoken word his lance."
He was less adept in political infighting in Israel.
"He could be a fierce turf fighter, yet it is fair to say that he could have fought harder for his moderate and dovish views in the post-1967 government in which he served."
"It is far from clear if he would have prevailed, given his lack of an independent political base, but his international prestige and standing might have given him a chance if he would have chosen to throw the gauntlet."
He never did.
Eban's silence in the last years was not only a product of his disenchantment with Israeli politics or his failing health.
"At a time when public debate in Israel is torn between pseudo-religious nationalist fanatics and anti-Zionists masquerading as post-modernists, the moral certitudes of Eban, for all their urbanity, may sound shallow."
"But nation-building requires moral stamina, and Eban provided it to his people and the world in abundance."
"Without having spoken to Eban in the last few years, I have no doubt that he would be extremely unhappy about the turn of events after the failure of Camp David and Taba in 2000-01, and the present course of Israeli policies would fill him with foreboding."
Yet in all probability he would have been even more deeply disappointed in the inability of the Palestinians to come to terms with the existence of the Jewish state.
"As an Arabist by training, immersed in Arab and Muslim culture, he always hoped that the glorious Arab past could be rejuvenated, that an Arab and Muslim culture of tolerance could triumph over fanaticism and extremism."
This was the bedrock of his hope for reconciliation between Jew and Arab.
That this Arab renaissance - to use the phrase of the great Palestinian scholar George Antonius - did not take place may have been Eban's greatest disappointment.
"Despite the high-born image Eban projected, he was an extremely vulnerable person: what some occasionally discerned as traits of vanity may have had their origins in his humble origins."
"While appearing to own the Queen's English, Eban was not to the manor born: he came from the extremely modest fringes of Anglo-Jewry."
"He was, in the true sense of the word, a self-made man, whose pluck, ambition, drive and inner belief in his destiny carried him to the pinnacle of his achievements."
His was the aristocracy of the spirit.
In this Abba Eban was a true representative of the people he so gloriously represented.
Abdullah Out On A Limb
"Crown Prince Abdullah’s peace proposal was born in Saudi Arabia but some allege that it was conceived in the US. Revealed to a visiting American journalist during a private dinner with the Crown Prince, the plan centers on a “full normalization” of relations between Israel and all Arab countries, in return for an Israeli withdrawal from all the Palestinian territories it occupied in 1967.  The proposal may get a boost when Abdullah meet President Bush in Texas later this spring, but its early survival depends first on its reception at the upcoming Arab summit in Beirut."
"The suspicions which surround Abdullah’s peace initiative, and which dismiss it as stillborn, are founded in the belief that it was conceived to appease Saudi Arabia’s American critics and to divert them from focussing on Saudi domestic tensions. Since September 11th, Saudi Arabia has felt intense pressure to explain (and explain away) its links to Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda terrorist network because fifteen of the nineteen plane hijackers were Saudis (indeed, the majority of prisoners held by the US at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba are said to be Saudi citizens) and Saudis are often viewed as a major source of al-Qaeda’s finances.  Moreover, it is alleged that the Saudi government has become preoccupied with appeasing America, despite the beginning of the second Palestinian intifada, and Israel’s ongoing occupation of Palestine."
"At the same time, Saudi public opinion has been inflamed, mostly because of their rulers’ apparent apathy toward the plight of the Palestinian people, particularly when contrasted with Osama bin Laden’s lethal propaganda. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11th, Saudi leaders have felt pressed to accommodate public revulsion about the mistreatment of the Palestinians, but worry that doing so may even further jeopardize their now brittle relations with America."
"Crown Prince Abdullah’s initiative provoked widespread surprise, not because the idea is so startlingly new, but because of its source and timing. A proposal for “full normalization” with Israel coming from an Islamic regime that bases its legitimacy on the austere Islamic doctrines of the Wahhabi seems both peculiar and progressive.  But Saudi Arabia’s long-cultivated image of stability, benevolence, and mystical communal harmony has given way under the endless glare of the American press.  Its educational system, too, is increasingly portrayed as a breeding ground for hatred of the West.  Something had to give."
"America’s seemingly hostile attention gave rise to the speculation that Crown Prince Abdullah’s initiative really denotes a Saudi public relations counteroffensive, hatched in the Saudi embassy in Washington to cover over the rift with the US. Indeed, the subsequent, deafening silence by other Saudi leaders to the proposal appears to confirm it as a public relations move for which they need not risk any of their own domestic political capital."
"Although Abdullah is usually referred to in the West as Saudi Arabia’s ruler, the debilitated King Fahd’s six full brothers are the ones who truly represent the real power in the Kingdom. Almost nothing, neither in support nor in opposition, has been uttered by the King and these other brothers, collectively known as the “Sudairis.”"
"The Sudairis, it seems, have apparently left their half brother alone to twist in the wind. Abdullah’s proposal could weaken his position domestically, particularly in relation to the country’s powerful Islamists."
"For although Crown Prince Abdullah has his own loyal entourage, including the National Guard, he confronts opposition from senior figures in the religious establishment."
The idea of normalizing relations with Israel has incited fierce hostility among some imams in the mosques as well as on the Internet.
"As a result, Abdullah’s initial proposal has been diluted, so much so that, by the time of the Arab foreign ministers meeting held in Cairo on 8 March, the phrase “full normalisation” was watered down to the more amorphous phrase “full peace,” the meaning of which no one knows."
"Does it mean an Israeli Star of David flag flying in Riyadh, or that Abdullah will visit Jerusalem to be greeted with a kiss from Ariel Sharon? No one knows, but the very fact that such questions are being raised in Saudi Arabia poses a serious risk to Abdullah."
"Objections are also voiced against the fact that the Crown Prince’s plan does not mention the right of exiled Palestinians to return to their homes in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as Israel proper, and that Arabs must tailor their diplomatic initiatives to the taste of the American media. To the average Saudi, the initiative appears as either a sell-out or the prelude to a fresh Arab humiliation.  In either case, it is widely feared that either of these outcomes is intended simply to appease America."
"Reactions in the Middle East reflect longstanding rivalries for leadership, as well as fears about American and Israeli intentions. Egypt’s leaders deem the proposal a mere conversation, something not nearly as serious as a written diplomatic initiative.  Libya offered its own supposedly more “encompassing and comprehensive” proposal."
"Hizbollah’s leader Mohammed Fadlallah defined the initiative as one of Arab submission, while Syria demanded a guarantee of its interests in the Golan Heights."
Arab League officials approved the proposal.
Crown Prince Abdullah’s initiative is meant to be made official during a speech at the Arab League summit in Beirut of 27-28 March.
"How it is received may not only determine the state of Israel-Palestine negotiations for a considerable time to come, but Saudi Arabia’s domestic peace as well."
A Berlin Consensus?
"HONG KONG – A recent trip to Berlin brought back memories of an earlier visit in the summer of 1967, when I was a poor student who marveled at the Wall that would divide and devastate an entire society for another two decades."
"Berlin today is vibrant and rejuvenated, rebuilt by the German peoples' hard work and sacrifice to unify the country, and an apt setting for the conference of the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET), which I was there to attend."
"The conference’s theme was “Paradigm Lost,” with more than 300 economists, political scientists, systems analysts, and ecologists gathering to rethink economic and political theory for the challenges and uncertainty posed by growing inequality, rising unemployment, global financial disarray, and climate change."
"Almost everyone agreed that the old paradigm of neoclassical economics was broken, but there was no agreement on what can replace it."
"Nobel laureate Amartya Sen attributed the European crisis to four failures – political, economic, social, and intellectual."
"The global financial crisis, which began in 2007 as a crisis of US subprime lending and has broadened into a European sovereign-debt (and banking) crisis, has raised questions that we cannot answer, owing to over-specialization and fragmentation of knowledge."
"And yet there is no denying that the world has become too intricate for any simple, overarching theory to explain complex economic, technological, demographic, and environmental shifts."
"In particular, the rise of emerging markets has challenged traditional Western deductive and inductive logic."
Deductive inference enables us to predict effects if we know the principles (the rule) and the cause.
"By inductive reasoning, if we know the cause and effects, we can infer the principles."
"Eastern thinking, by contrast, has been abductive, moving from pragmatism to guessing the next steps."
"Abductive inference is pragmatic, looking only at outcomes, guessing at the rule, and identifying the cause."
"Like history, social-scientific theory is written by the victors and shaped by the context and challenges of its time."
"Free-market thinking evolved from Anglo-Saxon theorists (many from Scotland), who migrated and colonized territories, allowing fortunate individuals to assume that there were no limits to consumption."
"European continental thinking, responding to urbanization and the need for social order, emphasized institutional analysis of political economy."
"Thus, the emergence of neoclassical economics in the nineteenth century was very much influenced by Newtonian and Cartesian physics, moving from qualitative analysis to quantifying human behavior by assuming rational behavior and excluding uncertainty."
"This “predetermined equilibrium” thinking – reflected in the view that markets always self-correct – led to policy paralysis until the Great Depression, when John Maynard Keynes’s argument for government intervention to address unemployment and output gaps gained traction."
"By the 1970’s, the neoclassical general-equilibrium school captured Keynesian economics through real-sector models that assumed that “finance is a veil,” thereby becoming blind to financial markets’ destabilizing effects."
"Economists like Hyman Minsky, who tried to correct this, were largely ignored as Milton Friedman and others led the profession’s push for free markets and minimal government intervention."
"But then technology, demographics, and globalization brought dramatic new challenges that the neoclassical approach could not foresee."
"Even as the world’s advanced countries over-consumed through leveraging from derivative finance, four billion of the world’s seven billion people began moving to middle-income status, making huge demands on global resources and raising the issue of ecological sustainability."
"New thinking is required to manage these massive and systemic changes, as well as the integration of giants like China and India into the modern world."
"A change of mindset is needed not just in the West, but also in the East."
"In 1987, the historian Ray Huang explained it for China:"
"“As the world enters the modern era, most countries under internal and external pressure need to reconstruct themselves by substituting the mode of governance rooted in agrarian experience with a new set of rules based on commerce.…This is easier said than done."
"The renewal process could affect the top and bottom layers, and inevitably it is necessary to recondition the institutional links between them."
Comprehensive destruction is often the order; and it may take decades to bring the work to completion.”
"Using this macro-historical framework, we can see Japanese deflation, European debt, and even the Arab Spring as phases of systemic changes within complex structures that are interacting with one another in a new, multipolar global system."
"We are witnessing simultaneous global convergence (the narrowing of income, wealth, and knowledge gaps between countries) and local divergence (widening income, wealth, and knowledge gaps within countries)."
Adaptive systems struggle with order and creativity as they evolve.
"As the philosopher Bertrand Russell presciently put it: “Security and justice require centralized governmental control, which must extend to the creation of a world government if it is to be effective."
"Progress, on the contrary, requires the utmost scope for personal initiative that is compatible with social order.”"
"A new wave of what the economist Joseph Schumpeter famously called “creative destruction” is under way: even as central banks struggle to maintain stability by flooding markets with liquidity, credit to business and households is shrinking."
We live in an age of simultaneous fear of inflation and deflation; of unprecedented prosperity amid growing inequality; and of technological advancement and resource depletion.
"Meanwhile, existing political systems promise good jobs, sound governance, a sustainable environment, and social harmony without sacrifice – a paradise of self-interested free riders that can be sustained only by sacrificing the natural environment and the welfare of future generations."
We cannot postpone the pain of adjustment forever by printing money.
Sustainability can be achieved only when the haves become willing to sacrifice for the have-nots.
The Washington Consensus of free-market reforms for developing countries ended more than two decades ago.
The INET conference in Berlin showed the need for a new one – a consensus that supports sacrifice in the interest of unity.
A Better and Safer Europe
"To many, myself included, NATO's enlargement to take in, among others, the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania -- which were once Soviet republics -- is an impossible dream come true."
"When the idea was first floated some 10 years ago, expansion into the Baltics was taken seriously by few people."
"Until recently, Russia's robust opposition to the idea posed a serious obstacle, because it sharpened the impression that Russia regarded its so-called ""near abroad"" as a zone of special interest and influence."
"NATO's enlargement makes it crystal clear that no country in the new Europe can be regarded as part of another country's ""zone."""
"It assures the three small Baltic countries that the nightmare of occupation by big neighbors (Hitler's Reich and Stalin's USSR), which they endured for half-a-century -- will not be repeated."
"By putting paid to any revanchist tendencies in Russia concerning the Baltics, Europe is made a safer place, and Russia is helped in its effort to redefine itself as a national state and not an empire."
"Expansion will also create a better Europe because enlargement widens the territory in which countries are committed to NATO's political values, including individual rights as well as the rights of minorities."
Fortunately Russia now seems to grasp the value of this political aspect of NATO-enlargement.
"Rightly so: enlargement of NATO is not an ""expansion"" that threatens Russia or other countries which strive for democratic political reforms."
"On the contrary, expansion takes away the worries - be they real or imagined - that surround the situation of the large Russian-speaking populations that now live outside of Russia but within the borders of the former Soviet Union."
"The civil rights of the Russian minorities in the Baltics and elsewhere are now enshrined in law, due in no small part to NATO demands."
"Those civil rights initiatives on the part of NATO reflect the increasingly workmanlike way that Russia, Europe, and America now work out their disagreements."
"Indeed, enlargement of NATO comes only a few days after a deal was struck between Russia and the EU on the tricky question of access to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad."
"This small piece of Russia, with 1 million inhabitants and bordering on the Baltic Sea, is squeezed between Poland and Lithuania, two future members of the EU."
This could have incited a complicated situation where Russians were faced with tough visa requirements when travelling between Kaliningrad and Russia proper.
A deal was struck between President Putin and the EU that makes access much easier without compromising the status of Lithuania and Poland within the EU-regime.
"This, in turn, created once again the kind of win-win situation that is so important for future relations between the EU and Russia."
"When the enlargement of the EU into Central and Eastern Europe is finally decided by the European Council in Copenhagen next month, the conclusion is clear: Europe has become a much better and safer place to live in, thanks to the decisions taken by NATO and the EU during the crucial autumn of 2002."
"But this is no cause for complacency. For the really hard work is only now beginning: dealing with all the internal practical and political problems that these enlargements will bring, as well as reckoning with countries in the membership waiting rooms, in particular Russia."
Relations with Russia are of vital importance if Europe is to continue to improve the quality of life of its citizens and address concerns of safety.
The common threat of international terrorism must be faced jointly.
We need to convince each other that the fight against this common enemy has to be fought with a keen eye to balancing the needs of security with those of human and minority rights.
Kaliningrad could be a litmus test of these relations.
The first hurdle has been overcome with the agreement on access to the enclave.
The next hurdle is to support Kalingrad's fight against disease and crime as well as strengthening its economic and social structures.
This calls for generosity from the EU and flexibility from Moscow.
"In a wider context this could lead to a strengthening of the so-called Northern Dimension of the EU, where the goal is a free trade area to include all the countries around the Baltic Sea."
Such a grand project can be achieved if the political will exists and asserts itself.
Only a few years ago EU and NATO enlargement were regarded as wild dreams.
But determination and political will has now made the dreams come true.
Now is the time to set new ambitious goals for Europe.
A Better Way to Reduce Nuclear Risk
"In 1977, when I served in President Jimmy Carter's State Department, I was sent to India to dissuade that country's leaders from developing a nuclear bomb."
My hosts replied that they needed to keep up with China.
I said that Pakistan would inevitably follow suit and the world would become less safe.
India promised that it would not export its weapons technology.
"So far as we know, its leaders have kept their word. But revelations about the nuclear weapons smuggling network organized by A. Q. Khan, the father of Pakistan's bomb, confirm the danger I predicted back then."
"Some call Khan's network an effort to spread an ""Islamic bomb,"" but given that North Korea was on the list of recipients along with Libya and Iran, it might better be termed a corrupt bomb."
"As events in Pakistan illustrate, the spread of nuclear technology does not extend the stability that comes with mutual deterrence."
"Rather, it increases the prospects of corrupt leakage that may allow terrorist groups access to nuclear weapons."
That makes everyone less safe.
"Any pathological group of extremists could destroy New Delhi, Tokyo, Paris, or any city they chose."
"Now the world's attention is focussed on Iran, one recipient of Pakistani technology, as the country seemingly keenest to create its own nuclear arsenal."
"According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran began enriching uranium at a pilot centrifuge plant last August, and is constructing larger underground enrichment facilities."
"Iran proclaims that its programs are for peaceful generation of nuclear energy, but inspectors have already found traces of highly enriched weapons-grade uranium."
"Last October, Mohamed El Baradei, the head of the IAEA, announced that Iran had accepted enhanced inspection procedures."
"In addition, after visits by the French, British, and German foreign ministers, Iran announced a temporary suspension of its enrichment program."
"Now it hints that it may resume enrichment, and recent press reports about the imports from Pakistan suggest Iran failed to disclose everything to the IAEA."
"Iran claims that as a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, it has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes."
"Correct, because the NPT was born with a loophole."
"Even if a country agrees to broad ranging IAEA inspections, it can legally accumulate enriched uranium (or reprocessed plutonium) under the guise of a peaceful energy program, and then suddenly declare that circumstances have changed and withdraw from the treaty - with the ability to produce nuclear weapons on short notice."
"If Iran did this, it would not only add to the dangers in an unstable region, but would likely begin a process of unravelling the non-proliferation regime worldwide."
Iran may ask what right others have to demand that it forego nuclear weapons.
The answer lies both in the fact that it promised not to do so when it signed the NPT and in the consequences that it would impose on others.
"For these reasons, President Bush declared an Iranian nuclear weapon unacceptable."
"However, America's unilateral options are limited."
"Not only is the US military busy trying in Iraq, but the way the US went into Iraq - which proved to have fewer nuclear capabilities than Iran - undermined American credibility, making it difficult to recruit allies to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions."
"Fortunately, there is a multilateral option and an existing precedent."
"In the mid-1970's, many parties to the NPT planned to import and develop enrichment and reprocessing facilities."
"Realizing the threat to the non-proliferation regime, countries as diverse as the Soviet Union, France, Germany, and Japan formed a ""Nuclear Suppliers Group"" that restrained the export of enrichment and reprocessing facilities."
That plugged part of the loophole in the treaty without amending it.
"Today, such countries should join together to offer Iran (and others) a deal."
Countries that wish to develop nuclear energy but not nuclear bombs should be given international guarantees of fuel supply and disposal of spent fuel.
"For example, Russia, which is helping Iran construct a nuclear reactor at Bushehr, should offer Iran a guarantee of low enriched uranium fuel and reprocessing of the reactor's spent fuel by sending it back to Russia if Iran agrees to forego enrichment and reprocessing."
This deal could then be given teeth by the UN Security Council.
"The Council would declare that further proliferation of nuclear weapons is a threat to peace, and that any country moving in that direction is subject to sanctions."
Such a resolution would also include a carrot by guaranteeing Iran access to the non-dangerous parts of the nuclear energy fuel cycle.
The pot could be further sweetened by offers to relax existing sanctions and provide a security guarantee if Iran remains non-nuclear.
European foreign ministers have already expressed their concerns about Iran's nuclear program.
Russia indicates that it is willing to provide such fuel services.
It is time for the Security Council to try to internationalize the most dangerous parts of the nuclear fuel cycle.
It is not too late to learn the lessons of the misadventures of A. Q. Khan.
A Big Chance for Small Farmer
"NEW YORK – The G-8’s $20 billion initiative on smallholder agriculture, launched at the group’s recent summit in L’Aquila, Italy, is a potentially historic breakthrough in the fight against hunger and extreme poverty."
"With serious management of the new funds, food production in Africa will soar."
"Indeed, the new initiative, combined with others in health, education, and infrastructure, could be the greatest step so far toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals, the internationally agreed effort to reduce extreme poverty, disease, and hunger by half by 2015 ."
"During 2002-2006, I led the United Nations Millennium Project, which aimed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, for then-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan."
"One cornerstone of the project was “smallholder farmers,” meaning peasant farm families in Africa, Latin America, and Asia – working farms of around one hectare (2.5 acres) or less."
"These are some of the poorest households in the world, and, ironically, some of the hungriest as well, despite being food producers."
"They are hungry because they lack the ability to buy high-yield seeds, fertilizer, irrigation equipment, and other tools needed to increase productivity."
"As a result, their output is meager and insufficient for their subsistence."
"Their poverty causes low farm productivity, and low farm productivity reinforces their poverty."
"It’s a vicious circle, technically known as a poverty trap."
"The UN Millennium Project’s Hunger Task Force, led by two world-leading scientists, M. S. Swaminathan and Pedro Sanchez, examined how to break this vicious circle."
"The Hunger Task Force determined that Africa could substantially increase its food production if help was given to smallholder farmers, in the form of agricultural inputs. The Millennium Project recommended a big increase in global funding for this purpose.  Drawing on that work and related scientific findings, Annan launched a call in 2004 for an African Green Revolution, based on an expanded partnership between Africa and donor countries."
"Many of us, notably current UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, have worked hard to make this possible, with Ban repeatedly emphasizing the special emergency arising from the global food, financial, and energy crises of the past two years."
"The G-8 announcement reflects these years of effort, and of course the boost from the leadership of US President Barack Obama, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Zapatero, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, World Bank President Robert Zoellick, European Commissioner Louis Michel, European Parliamentarian Thijs Berman, and others."
Now the key is to make this effort work.
The lessons of history are clear.
Getting seed and fertilizer to smallholder farmers at highly subsidized prices (or even free in some cases) will make a lasting difference.
"Not only will food yields rise in the short term, but farm households will use their higher incomes and better health to accumulate all sorts of assets: cash balances, soil nutrients, farm animals, and their children’s health and education."
"That boost in assets will, in turn, enable local credit markets, such as micro-finance, to begin operating."
"Farmers will be able to buy inputs, either out of their own cash, or by borrowing against their improved creditworthiness."
"A consensus has now been reached on the need to assist smallholders, but obstacles remain."
"Perhaps the main risk is that the “aid bureaucracies” now trip over each other to try to get their hands on the $20 billion, so that much of it gets taken up by meetings, expert consultations, overhead, reports, and further meetings."
"“Partnerships” of donors can become an expensive end in themselves, merely delaying real action."
"If donor governments really want results, they should take the money out of the hands of thirty or more separate aid bureaucracies and pool it in one or two places, the most logical being the World Bank in Washington and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in Rome."
One or both of these agencies would then have an account with several billion dollars.
"Governments in hunger-stricken regions, especially Africa, would then submit national action plans that would provide details on how they would use the donor funds to get high-yield seeds, fertilizer, irrigation, farm tools, storage silos, and local advice to impoverished farmers."
An independent expert panel would review the national plans to verify their scientific and managerial coherence.
"Assuming that a plan passes muster, the money to support it would quickly be disbursed."
"Afterward, each national program would be monitored, audited, and evaluated."
"This approach is straightforward, efficient, accountable, and scientifically sound."
"Two major recent success stories in aid have used this approach: the Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunizations, which successfully gets immunizations to young children, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, which supports national action plans to battle these killer diseases."
"Both have saved millions of lives during the past decade, and have paved the way to a new more efficient and scientifically sound method of development assistance."
"Not surprisingly, many UN agencies and aid agencies in rich countries fight this approach."
"All too often, the fight is about turf, rather than about the most effective way to speed help to the poor."
"Obama, Rudd, Zapatero, and other forward-thinking leaders can therefore make a huge difference by following up on their pledges at the G-8 and insisting that the aid really works."
The bureaucracies must be bypassed to get help to where it is needed: in the soil tilled by the world’s poorest farm families.
A Black and White Question
"NEW YORK – In the afternoon of July 16 two men appeared to be breaking into a fine house in an expensive area of Cambridge, Massachusetts."
"Alerted by a telephone call, a policeman arrived smartly on the scene."
He saw one black male standing inside the house and asked him to come out.
The man refused. He was then told to identify himself.
"The man, still refusing to step out, said he was a Harvard professor, showed his ID, and warned the cop not to mess with him."
"He said something about black men in America being singled out, and asked the cop, who was white, for his name and identification."
"The cop, joined by several colleagues, arrested the professor for disorderly conduct."
"We now know that the professor had broken into his own home, with the help of his chauffeur, because the door was jammed."
What was unusual here was not the cop’s heavy-handedness.
"Most people in the US know that if you talk back to the police, they will get nasty very fast."
The fact that the man was black might or might not have made the cop go for his handcuffs even sooner than he might normally have done.
"That, too, would not have been unusual."
"What made this case special was that Henry Louis “Skip” Gates is one of the most celebrated professors in the country, famous for his books, his articles, and numerous television appearances."
"He is a grandee, a mover and shaker in the academic and media world, a friend of President Barack Obama."
"That is why he warned the cop, Sgt. James Crowley, a veteran of the Cambridge police force, not to mess with him."
Class and race overlap in the US.
"In this instance, it is impossible to pry them apart."
"Gates, deeply conscious, indeed a specialist of the terrible history of race relations in his country, instinctively assumed that he was a victim of prejudice."
From his words it appears that he was equally conscious of not getting the proper respect due to a distinguished Harvard professor and media celebrity.
"As he put it to his daughter in an interview published online: “[Crowley] should have gotten out of there and said, ‘I’m sorry, sir, good luck."
Loved your [television] series—check with you later!’”
"Alas, Sgt.Crowley had never heard of Professor Gates."
"A local man whose brothers all serve in the police force, a sports fan, and an amateur basketball coach, Crowley does not move in the same social circles as Gates."
"As it happens, the charges were duly dropped, and there the case might have rested if President Obama, tired and frustrated after weeks of fighting for his healthcare bill, had not weighed in on behalf of his “friend” Gates, and called the police “stupid.”"
Both he and Gates then spoke of “learning” from the incident.
Gates might even be planning a television documentary on racial profiling.
"One thing to be learned, if we didn’t know this already, is how close racial sensitivities are to the surface of US life, despite the election of a black president."
"The complexities of black anger, white guilt, and of black, and white fear, are so vexed that most Americans prefer not to talk about race at all."
The field is too full of mines.
One of Obama’s great achievements is that he made it into a serious topic through the brilliance and subtlety of his rhetoric.
"And there remains plenty to talk about: the grotesquely disproportionate number of black men in US prisons; the lack of educational opportunities in poor, mostly black areas; the appalling healthcare system; and the very real brutality used by police officers against blacks, who don’t have the privilege of a Harvard ID."
"It is probably true that many white policemen, even if they are trained to avoid racial profiling, as Sgt. Crowley was, need to be convinced that a black man can be at home in one of the finer houses of Cambridge, or any other American city."
But is the Gates affair the right way to enter into this discussion?
One might argue that it
"There is, however, a danger that it will have an adverse affect on the necessary national discussion about race."
By having made such a big issue out of what was in fact a relatively minor event Gates could be accused of trivializing much worse instances of abuse.
"Indeed, we don’t even know for certain whether this was such an instance."
Crowley never mentioned the color of Gates’ skin.
There was no question of violence.
"There were just very raw nerves and hypersensitivity to hints of disrespect, on the part of the professor, and of the cop."
"Outrage about a professor who is not to be messed with is not the best way to discuss the plight of countless, poor, anonymous people, whom most of us find it too easy to ignore."
A Bollywood Bride for Sarkozy?
"PARIS &#45;&#45; Ever since French President Nicolas Sarkozy took himself off his country’s most-eligible-bachelor list by publicly acknowledging his affair with supermodel-turned-pop-musician Carla Bruni during a romantic trip to Euro Disney, he’s run into trouble."
His ratings have dipped below 50% for the first time.
Older French citizens don’t find the public spectacle of their leader in love very amusing.
"Abroad, Egyptian lawmakers were so exercised over the prospect of the French head of state sharing a bed with his girlfriend that several vented their disapproval on the floor of the parliament."
"Likewise, India is all in a quandary over how to handle protocol during Sarkozy’s impending visit to the subcontinent as the guest of honor at the country’s Republic Day celebrations on January 26."
"Should the First Girlfriend have her own motorcade, as a first lady would?"
"Meanwhile, the same hard-right Hindu groups that protest Valentine’s Day as a decadent Western holiday have warned that if Sarkozy arrives with his girlfriend in tow, they’ll be out in the streets to welcome him."
This controversy has threatened to cast a pall over a much-heralded summit between two of the world’s great democracies.
"With lucrative deals at stake for the big-ticket products that drive the French economy – military hardware, nuclear power plants, and Airbus planes – France has a strong interest in a successful summit in India."
"So, as rumors fly of secret marriage ceremonies either already concluded or in the works, could the trouble brewing in India over the French president’s very public love life be behind the rush to have the couple legally wed?"
The news in Sarkozy’s favored media outlet
"It’s “serious,” the smitten president admitted. But he refused, even under direct questioning by reporters, to reveal an exact date."
"“You’ll probably find out after it’s happened,” he taunted."
"Rumor has it the couple has set February 8 or 9 for the wedding. Others say that Sarkozy has already outsmarted the media by secretly marrying in the Elysee Palace, even as he was dodging wedding questions."
"If that is true, then Sarkozy missed the romantic opportunity of a lifetime."
"If the couple sizzled for cameras with Luxor and Petra as the backdrop, just imagine how hot things could get at the most romantic spot on Earth, the Taj Mahal. And, given the current rage for all things Bollywood in France, a lavish Indian wedding would be fitting."
Bruni’s own life path closely resembles any number of Bollywood stars who have made the transition from model to actress.
A comely brunette who sings is perfect for a Bollywood makeover.
The Indian government will be nothing if not relieved to see the first girlfriend made a wife.
"As one of India’s leading daily newspapers, the"
"Despite the sometimes downright pornographic on-screen writhing of Bollywood starlets, India is still a deeply conservative society. Divorce is anathema."
(Sarkozy is now twice divorced.)
"And, while mistresses abound among the privileged classes, they do not strut publicly by their power-mates’ sides."
"Kissing and fondling in public, even by spouses, is taboo."
"In this respect, India more resembles the France with which Sarkozy wants to make a clean break than the current one."
"Most Indians, as it seems many French, would prefer not to shed the “hypocrisy” Sarkozy laments on the part of his predecessors (read: former French President François Mitterrand, who had a child with his mistress about whom the public knew nothing until the man’s funeral)."
"Statecraft is a realm where appearances are meant to be deceiving. When Sarkozy, who otherwise has such finely tuned media instincts, protests that he’s no different from any other man, he comes dangerously close to confusing the office and the person of the president."
Most French people could only dream of an exotic wedding in India.
Sarkozy could make that dream come true.
"If he really is as head-over-heels in love with Bruni as he claims, and plans to marry her imminently, why not take advantage of his upcoming trip to India and make this a wedding to remember?"
"He could meet his bride seated majestically on the caparison of an elaborately decorated elephant, and she would look ravishing swathed and bejeweled in Indian finery."
"The “bling-bling” president, as Sarkozy has been dubbed, can wear all the gold he wants and heap yet more diamonds on his bride."
"The cameras would roll, Indians would smile, and France would be treated to a Bollywood spectacle beyond its wildest dreams."
"And if it’s too late for the wedding, there’s always the reception."
A Bomb in Every Reactor
"BERLIN – Twenty-five years after the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, the ongoing catastrophe at the Fukushima nuclear reactor in Japan has – it must be hoped – made clear once and for all that the purported blessings of the nuclear age are mere illusions: nuclear power is neither clean nor safe nor cheap."
"Indeed, the opposite is true."
"Nuclear power is saddled with three major unresolved risks: plant safety, nuclear waste, and, most menacing of all, the risk of military proliferation."
"Moreover, the alternatives to nuclear energy – and to fossil fuels – are well known and technically much more advanced and sustainable."
Taking on nuclear risk is not a necessity; it is a deliberate political choice.
"Fossil-fuel and nuclear energy belong to the technological utopias of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which were based on a belief in the innocence of the technologically feasible and on the fact that, at the time, only a minority of people worldwide, largely in the West, benefited from technological progress."
"By contrast, the twenty-first century will be informed by the realization that the global ecosystem and its resources, which are indispensable for human survival, are finite, and that this implies an enduring responsibility to preserve what we have."
Meeting this imperative entails both an enormous technological challenge and an opportunity to redefine the meaning of modernity.
"The energy future of nine billion people, which is what the world population will be in the middle of the century, lies neither in fossil fuels nor in nuclear energy, but in renewable energy sources and dramatic improvements in energy efficiency."
We already know this.
"Why, then, do the most advanced countries, in particular, take on the risk of a mega-catastrophe by seeking to create energy from radioactive fission?"
"The answer, ultimately, doesn’t lie with any civilian use of nuclear energy, but first and foremost with its military applications."
"The energy derived from splitting uranium and plutonium atoms was originally used for the ultimate weapon, the atomic bomb."
Being a nuclear power provides sovereign states with protection and prestige.
"Even today, the Bomb divides the world into two classes: the few states have it, and the many that do not."
"The old Cold War world order was based on the nuclear arms race between the two superpowers, the United States and Soviet Union."
"To stop others from trying to become nuclear powers, which would have multiplied and spread the risk of nuclear confrontation, the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) was framed in the 1960’s. To this day, it governs the relationships between the nuclear powers and the rest of the world, imposing renunciation on the have-nots and nuclear-disarmament obligations on the haves."
"Of course, the NPT has repeatedly been violated or circumvented by states that never subscribed to it."
"To this day, therefore, the risk remains that the number of nuclear powers will increase, particularly given small and medium powers’ hope to enhance their prestige and position in regional conflicts."
Iran is the most current example of this.
"The nuclearization of these not-always-stable states threatens to make the regional conflicts of the twenty-first century much more dangerous, and will also substantially increase the risk that nuclear weapons eventually end up in the hands of terrorists."
"Despite the NPT, a clear separation between civilian and military use of nuclear energy hasn’t always worked, or worked completely, because the NPT’s rules permit all signatory states to develop and use – under international supervision – all of the components of the nuclear fuel cycle for civilian purposes."
"From here, then, all that is required to become a nuclear power are a few small technical steps and political leaders’ decision to take them."
"This political power, not the requirements of energy policy, is what makes giving up nuclear energy so difficult."
"As a rule, the path to nuclear-power status always begins with so-called “civilian” nuclear programs."
"The supposed “civilian” nuclear ambitions of Iran have thus, for instance, led to a large number of such “civilian” programs in neighboring states."
Honni soit qui mal y pense!
"And, of course, the reactions of the nuclear powers to the disaster at Fukushima will be watched and analyzed closely by the so-called “clandestine threshold countries.”"
"So how will the world – first and foremost, the main nuclear powers – react to the Fukushima disaster?"
"Will the tide truly turn, propelling the world towards nuclear disarmament and a future free of nuclear weapons?"
Or will we witness attempts to downplay the calamity and return to business as usual as soon as possible?
"Fukushima has presented the world with a far-reaching, fundamental choice."
"It was Japan, the high-tech country par excellence (not the latter-day Soviet Union) that proved unable to take adequate precautions to avert disaster in four reactor blocks."
"What, then, will a future risk assessment look like if significantly less organized and developed countries begin – with the active assistance of the nuclear powers – to acquire civilian nuclear-energy capabilities?"
"Any decision to continue as before would send an unambiguous message to the clandestine threshold countries that are secretly pursuing nuclear weapons: despite lofty rhetoric and wordy documents, the nuclear powers lack the political will to change course."
"Were they to abandon nuclear energy, however, their epochal change of heart would constitute a seminal contribution to global nuclear security – and thus to the fight against nuclear proliferation."
A Breakthrough Against Hunger
NEW YORK – Today’s world hunger crisis is unprecedentedly severe and requires urgent measures.
Nearly one billion people are trapped in chronic hunger – perhaps 100 million more than two years ago.
Spain is taking global leadership in combating hunger by inviting world leaders to Madrid in late January to move beyond words to action.
"With Spain’s leadership and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s partnership, several donor governments are proposing to pool their financial resources so that the world’s poorest farmers can grow more food and escape the poverty trap."
The benefits of some donor help can be remarkable.
"Peasant farmers in Africa, Haiti, and other impoverished regions currently plant their crops without the benefit of high-yield seed varieties and fertilizers."
"The result is a grain yield (for example, maize) that is roughly one-third less than what could be achieved with better farm inputs."
"African farmers produce roughly one ton of grain per hectare, compared with more than four tons per hectare in China, where farmers use fertilizers heavily."
African farmers know that they need fertilizer; they just can’t afford it.
"With donor help, they can."
"Not only do these farmers then feed their families, but they also can begin to earn market income and to save for the future."
"By building up savings over a few years, the farmers eventually become creditworthy, or have enough cash to purchase vitally necessary inputs on their own."
"There is now widespread agreement on the need for increased donor financing for small farmers (those with two hectares or less of land, or impoverished pastoralists), which is especially urgent in Africa."
"The UN Secretary General led a steering group last year that determined that African agriculture needs around $8 billion per year in donor financing – roughly four times the current total – with a heavy emphasis on improved seeds, fertilizer, irrigation systems, and extension training."
"In addition to direct help for small farms, donors should provide more help for the research and development needed to identify new high-yielding seed varieties, especially to breed plants that can withstand temporary flooding, excess nitrogen, salty soils, crop pests, and other challenges to sustainable food production."
"Helping the poor with today’s technologies, while investing in future improved technologies, is the optimum division of labor."
"This investment pays off wonderfully, with research centers such as the International Rice Research Institute and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre providing the high-yield seeds and innovative farming strategies that together triggered the Asian Green Revolution."
"These centers are not household names, but they deserve to be."
"Their scientific breakthroughs have helped to feed the world, and we’ll need more of them."
"Dozens of low-income, food-deficit countries, perhaps as many as 40-50, have elaborated urgent programs for increased food production by small farms, but are currently held back by the lack of donor funding."
"These countries have appealed to the World Bank for financing, and the Bank made a valiant effort in 2008 to help through its new Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFCRP)."
"But the Bank does not yet have sufficient funds to meet these countries’ urgent needs, and has had to ration assistance to a small fraction of the flows that could be effectively and reliably used."
"Hundreds of millions of people, in the meantime, remain trapped in hunger."
"Many individual donor countries have declared that they are now prepared to increase their financial support for smallholder agriculture, but are searching for the appropriate mechanisms to do so."
The current aid structures are inadequate.
The more than 20 bilateral and multilateral donor agencies for agriculture are highly fragmented and of insufficient scale individually and collectively.
"Despite the dedicated efforts of many professionals, the response to the hunger crisis remains utterly inadequate."
The 2008 planting seasons came and went with much too little additional help for impoverished small farmers.
"African countries search endlessly, and mostly fruitlessly, for the small amounts of funding needed for their purchases of fertilizer and improved seeds."
"My colleagues and I, serving on an advisory committee for the Spanish initiative, have recommended that donors pool their funds into a single international account, which we call the Financial Coordination Mechanism (FCM)."
"These pooled funds would enable farmers in poor countries to obtain the fertilizer, improved seed varieties, and small-scale irrigation equipment that they urgently need."
"Poor countries would receive prompt and predictable financing for agricultural inputs from a single account, rather than from dozens of distinct and fragmented donors."
"By pooling financial resources into a single-donor FCM, aid programs’ administrative costs could be kept low, the availability of aid flows could be assured, and poor countries would not have to negotiate 25 times in order to receive help."
The time for business as usual is over.
"The donors promised to double aid to Africa by 2010, but are still far off track."
"Indeed, during the past 20 years, they actually cut aid for agriculture programs, and only now are reversing course."
"Meanwhile, a billion people go hungry each day."
"We need a breakthrough that is demonstrable, public, clear, and convincing, that can mobilize the public’s hearts and minds, and that can demonstrate success."
"History can be made in Madrid at the end of January, when the world’s richest and poorest countries converge to seek solutions to the global hunger crisis."
The lives of the billion poorest people depend on it.
A Breakthrough Opportunity for Global Health
"NEW YORK – Every year, millions of people die from preventable and treatable diseases, especially in poor countries."
"In many cases, lifesaving medicines can be cheaply mass-produced, but are sold at prices that block access to those who need them."
"And many die simply because there are no cures or vaccines, because so little of the world’s valuable research talent and limited resources is devoted to addressing the diseases of the poor."
This state of affairs represents a failure of economics and law that urgently needs to be corrected.
"The good news is that there are now opportunities for change, most promisingly through an international effort headed by the World Health Organization that would begin to fix the broken intellectual-property regime that is holding back the development and availability of cheap drugs."
Two main problems limit the availability of medicines today.
"One is that they are very costly; or, more accurately, the price charged for them is very high, though the cost of producing them is but a fraction of that amount."
"Second, drug development is geared toward maximizing profit, not social benefit, which skews efforts directed at the creation of medicines that are essential to human welfare."
"Because the poor have so little money to spend, drug companies, under current arrangements, have little incentive to do research on the diseases that afflict them."
It doesn’t have to be this way.
Drug companies argue that high prices are necessary to fund research and development.
"But, in the United States, it is actually the government that finances most health-related research and development – directly, through public support (National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation), and indirectly, through public purchases of medicine, both in the Medicare and Medicaid programs."
Even the part that is not government-financed is not a conventional market; most individuals’ purchases of prescription medicines are covered by insurance.
Government finances health-care research because improved medicines are a public good.
The resulting knowledge benefits everyone by stopping epidemics and limiting the economic and human toll of widespread illness.
Efficiency requires sharing research as widely as possible as soon as it is available.
"Thomas Jefferson compared knowledge to candles: when one is used to light another, it does not diminish the light of the first."
"On the contrary, everything becomes brighter."
"Yet, in America and most of the world, drug prices are still exorbitant and the spread of knowledge is tightly limited."
"That is because we have created a patent system that gives innovators a temporary monopoly over what they create, which encourages them to hoard their knowledge, lest they help a competitor."
"While this system does provide incentives for certain kinds of research by making innovation profitable, it allows drug companies to drive up prices, and the incentives do not necessarily correspond to social returns."
"In the health-care sector, it may be more profitable to devote research to a “me-too” drug than to the development of a treatment that really makes a difference."
"The patent system may even have adverse effects on innovation, because, while the most important input into any research is prior ideas, the patent system encourages secrecy."
A solution to both high prices and misdirected research is to replace the current model with a government-supported prize fund.
"With a prize system, innovators are rewarded for new knowledge, but they do not retain a monopoly on its use."
"That way, the power of competitive markets can ensure that, once a drug is developed, it is made available at the lowest possible price – not at an inflated monopoly price."
"Fortunately, some US lawmakers are taking a strong interest in this approach."
"The Prize Fund for HIV/AIDS Act, a congressional bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders, is just such an initiative."
"His bill also contains an important provision aimed at encouraging open-source research, which would move the current research model away from secrecy toward sharing."
"But, globally, our innovation system needs much bigger changes."
The WHO’s efforts to encourage broad reforms at the international level are crucial.
"This spring, the WHO released a report that recommends solutions similar to those proposed in the US Senate bill, but on a global level."
"Importantly, the report, “Research and Development to Meet Health Needs in Developing Countries,” recommends a comprehensive approach, including mandatory funding contributions from governments for research on developing countries’ health needs; international coordination of health-care priorities and implementation; and a global observatory that would monitor where needs are greatest."
"In late May, the international community will have a chance to begin implementing these ideas at the WHO World Health Assembly – a moment of hope for public health around the world."
Reforming our innovation system is not just a matter of economics.
"It is, in many cases, a matter of life and death."
"It is therefore essential to de-link R&amp;D incentives from drug prices, and to promote greater sharing of scientific knowledge."
"For America, the Sanders bill marks important progress."
"For the world, the WHO’s recommendations represent a once-in-a-generation opportunity to remedy a long-standing and egregious inequity in health care, and, more broadly, to set a model for governance of global public goods befitting an era of globalization."
We cannot afford to let this opportunity pass us by.
Absent-Minded Killer
"As a species, human beings have a major self-control problem."
"We humans are now so aggressively fishing, hunting, logging, and growing crops in all parts of the world that we are literally chasing other species off the planet."
Our intense desire to take all that we can from nature leaves precious little for other forms of life.
"In 1992, when the world’s governments first promised to address man-made global warming, they also vowed to head off the human-induced extinction of other species."
"The Convention on Biological Diversity, agreed at the Rio Earth Summit, established that “biological diversity is a common concern of humanity.”"
"The signatories agreed to conserve biological diversity, by saving species and their habitats, and to use biological resources (e.g., forests) in a sustainable manner."
"In 2002, the treaty’s signatories went further, committing to “a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss” by 2010."
"Unfortunately, like so many other international agreements, the Convention on Biological Diversity remains essentially unknown, un-championed, and unfulfilled."
That neglect is a human tragedy.
For a very low cash outlay – and perhaps none at all on balance – we could conserve nature and thus protect the basis of our own lives and livelihoods.
"We kill other species not because we must, but because we are too negligent to do otherwise."
Consider a couple of notorious examples.
"Some rich countries, such as Spain, Portugal, Australia, and New Zealand, have fishing fleets that engage in so-called “bottom trawling.”"
"Bottom trawlers drag heavy nets over the ocean bottom, destroying magnificent, unexplored, and endangered marine species in the process."
"Complex and unique ecologies, most notably underground volcanoes known as seamounts, are ripped to shreds, because bottom trawling is the “low cost” way to catch a few deep sea fish species."
"One of these species, orange roughy, has been caught commercially for only around a quarter-century, but already is being fished to the point of collapse."
"Likewise, in many parts of the world, tropical rainforest is being cleared for pasture land and food crops."
"The result is massive loss of habitat and destruction of species, yielding a tiny economic benefit at a huge social cost."
"After cutting down a swath of rainforest, soils are often quickly leached of their nutrients so that they cannot sustain crops or nutritious grasses for livestock."
"As a result, the new pasture land or farmland is soon abandoned, with no prospect for regeneration of the original forest and its unique ecosystems."
"Because these activities’ costs are so high and their benefits so low, stopping them would be easy."
Bottom trawling should simply be outlawed; it would be simple and inexpensive to compensate the fishing industry during a transition to other activities.
"Forest clearing, on the other hand, is probably best stopped by economic incentives, perhaps combined with regulatory limits."
"Simply restricting the practice of land clearing probably would not work, since farm families and communities would face a strong temptation to evade legal limits."
"On the other hand, financial incentives would probably succeed, because cutting down forest to create pastureland is not profitable enough to induce farmers to forego payments for protecting the land."
"Many rainforest countries have united in recent years to suggest the establishment of a rainforest conservation fund by the rich countries, to pay impoverished small farmers a small amount of money to preserve the forest."
"A well-designed fund would slow or stop deforestation, preserve biodiversity, and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide the burning of cleared forests."
"At the same time, small farmers would receive a steady flow of income, which they could use for micro-investments to improve their household’s wealth, education, and health."
"Aside from banning bottom trawling and establishing a global fund for avoided deforestation, we should designate a global network of protected marine areas, in which fishing, boating, polluting, dredging, drilling, and other damaging activities would be prohibited."
"Such areas not only permit the regeneration of species, but also provide ecological benefits that spill over to neighboring unprotected areas."
"We also need a regular scientific process to present the world with the evidence on species abundance and extinction, just as we now have such a process for climate change."
"Politicians don’t listen very well to individual scientists, but they are forced to listen when hundreds of scientists speak with a united voice."
"Finally, the world should negotiate a new framework no later than 2010 to slow human-induced climate change."
There can be little doubt that climate change poses one of the greatest risks to species’ viability.
"As the planet warms, and rain and storm patterns change dramatically, many species will find themselves in climate zones that no longer support their survival."
"Some can migrate, but others (such as polar bears) are likely to be driven to extinction unless we take decisive action to head off climate change."
These measures are achievable by 2010.
"They are affordable, and in each case would ultimately deliver large net benefits."
"Most importantly, they would allow us to follow through on a global promise."
It is too painful to believe that humanity would destroy millions of other species – and jeopardize our own future – in a fit of absent-mindedness.
Making Do With More
"BERKELEY – In the United States, just three out of ten workers are needed to produce and deliver the goods we consume."
"Everything we extract, grow, design, build, make, engineer, and transport – down to brewing a cup of coffee in a restaurant kitchen and carrying it to a customer's table – is done by roughly 30% of the country's workforce."
"The rest of us spend our time planning what to make, deciding where to install the things we have made, performing personal services, talking to each other, and keeping track of what is being done, so that we can figure out what needs to be done next."
"And yet, despite our obvious ability to produce much more than we need, we do not seem to be blessed with an embarrassment of riches."
One of the great paradoxes of our time is that workers and middle-class households continue to struggle in a time of unparalleled plenty.
We in the developed countries have more than enough to cover our basic needs.
"We have enough organic carbon-hydrogen bonds to break to provide us with calories; enough vitamins and other nutrients to keep us healthy; enough shelter to keep us dry; enough clothing to keep us warm; enough capital to keep us, at least potentially, productive; and enough entertainment to keep us from being bored."
And we produce all of it for an average of less than two hours a day of work outside the home.
"John Maynard Keynes was not off by much when he famously predicted in 1930 that the human race's “economic problem, the struggle for subsistence,"" was likely to be “solved, or be at least within sight of solution, within a hundred years."""
"It will take another generation, perhaps, before robots have completely taken over manufacturing, kitchen work, and construction; and the developing world looks to be 50 years behind."
But Keynes would have been spot on had he targeted his essay at his readers' great-great-great-great grandchildren.
And yet there are few signs that working- and middle-class Americans are living any better than they did 35 years ago.
"Even stranger, productivity growth does not seem to be soaring, as one would expect; in fact, it seems to be decelerating, according to research by John Fernald and Bing Wang, economists in the Economic Research Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco."
"Growth prospects are even worse, as innovation hits gale-force headwinds."
One way to reconcile the changes in the job market with our lived experience and statistics like these is to note that much of what we are producing is very different from what we have made in the past.
"For most of human experience, the bulk of what we produced could not be easily shared or used without permission."
"The goods we made were what economists call “rival"" and “excludible"" commodities."
"Being “rival"" means that two people cannot use the same product at the same time."
"Being “excludible"" means that the owner of a product can easily prevent others from using it."
"These two traits put a great deal of bargaining power in the hands of those who control production and distribution, making them ideal for a market economy based on private property."
Money naturally flows to where utility and value are being provided – and those flows are easy to track in national accounts.
But much of what we are producing in the information age is neither rival nor excludible – and this changes the entire picture.
The creation of information-age goods is difficult to incentivize; their distribution is hard to monetize; and we lack the tools to track them easily in national accounts.
The result is an ever-growing discrepancy between what people would be willing to pay for a given service and growth as measured in national statistics.
"In other words, we are producing and consuming much more than our economic indicators suggest – and the creators of many of those products are not being adequately compensated."
This produces a set of unique problems.
To ensure that the workers of today and tomorrow are able to capture the benefits of the information age will require us to redesign our economic system to stimulate the creation of these new types of commodities.
"In addition to developing ways to account for this new type of wealth, we will have to develop channels through which demand for a product contributes to the income of its creator."
"Only by finding ways to put true value on the goods we produce will we be able to sustain a middle-class society, rather than one of techno-plutocrats and their service-sector serfs."
Polluters Must Pay
"NEW YORK – When BP and its drilling partners caused the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, the United States government demanded that BP finance the cleanup, compensate those who suffered damages, and pay criminal penalties for the violations that led to the disaster."
BP has already committed more than $20 billion in remediation and penalties.
"Based on a settlement last week, BP will now pay the largest criminal penalty in US history – $4.5 billion."
"The same standards for environmental cleanup need to be applied to global companies operating in poorer countries, where their power has typically been so great relative to that of governments that many act with impunity, wreaking havoc on the environment with little or no accountability."
"As we enter a new era of sustainable development, impunity must turn to responsibility."
"Polluters must pay, whether in rich or poor countries."
Major companies need to accept responsibility for their actions.
Nigeria has been Exhibit A of corporate environmental impunity.
"For decades, major oil companies, including Shell, ExxonMobil, and Chevron, have been producing oil in the Niger Delta, an ecologically fragile environment of freshwater swamp forests, mangroves, lowland rainforests, and coastal barrier islands."
"This rich habitat supports remarkable biodiversity – or did before the oil companies got there –&#160;and more than 30 million local inhabitants, who depend on the local ecosystems for their health and livelihoods."
"Twenty years ago, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources classified the Niger Delta as a region of high biodiversity of marine and coastal flora and fauna – tree species, fish, birds, and mammals, among other forms of life – and therefore rated it as a very high priority for conservation."
"Yet it also noted that the region’s biodiversity was under massive threat, with little or no protection."
"The global companies operating in the delta have spilled oil and flared natural gas for decades, without regard for the natural environment and the communities impoverished and poisoned by their actions."
One estimate puts the cumulative spills over the past 50 years at approximately 10 million barrels – twice the size of the BP spill.
The data are uncertain: there have been many thousands of spills during this period – often poorly documented and their magnitude hidden or simply unmeasured by either the companies or the government.
"Indeed, just as BP was being hit with new criminal penalties, ExxonMobil announced yet another pipeline leak in the Niger Delta."
The environmental destruction of the delta is part of a larger saga: corrupt companies operating hand in hand with corrupt government officials.
"The companies routinely bribe officials to gain oil leases, lie about output, evade taxes, and dodge responsibility for the environmental damage that they cause."
"Nigerian officials have become fabulously wealthy, owing to decades of payoffs by international companies that have plundered the delta’s natural wealth."
"Shell, the largest foreign operator in the Niger Delta, has been criticized repeatedly for its egregious practices and its unwillingness to be held to account."
"Meanwhile, the local population has remained impoverished and beset by diseases caused by unsafe air, poisoned drinking water, and pollution in the food chain."
"Local lawlessness has led to gang warfare and persistent illegal tapping into the pipelines to steal oil, leading to further massive oil spills and frequent explosions that kill dozens, including innocent bystanders."
"In the colonial era, it was the official purpose of imperial power to extract wealth from the administered territories."
"In the post-colonial period, the methods are better disguised."
"When oil companies misbehave in Nigeria or elsewhere, they are protected by the power of their home countries."
"Don’t mess with the companies, they are told by the United States and Europe."
"Indeed, one of the largest bribes (a reputed $180 million) paid in recent times in Nigeria was by Halliburton, a company tightly intertwined with US political power."
(Dick Cheney went from being Halliburton’s CEO to the US vice presidency.)
"Last year, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) issued a remarkable report on Ogoniland, a major ethnic homeland in the Niger Delta that has been at the epicenter of conflict between local communities and international oil."
The report was as scathing as it was scientifically clear.
"Despite many past promises of a cleanup, Ogoniland remains in environmental agony, impoverished and sickened by the oil industry."
"UNEP also offered clear and detailed recommendations, including emergency measures to ensure safe drinking water; cleanup activities targeting the mangroves and soils; public-health studies to identify and counteract the consequences of pollution; and a new regulatory framework."
"The world’s governments have recently agreed to move to a new framework for sustainable development, declaring their intention to adopt Sustainable Development Goals at the Rio+20 Summit in June."
"The SDGs offer a critical opportunity for the world to set clear, compelling standards for government and corporate behavior."
"Many major companies, including in the oil industry, have expressed their readiness to support sustainable development goals."
Cleaning up the Niger Delta would provide the strongest possible example of a new age of accountability.
"Shell, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and other major oil companies should step forward and help to fund the necessary cleanup, ushering in a new era of responsibility."
The Nigerian government’s own accountability is on the line as well.
It is heartening that several Nigerian senators have recently been in the forefront of efforts to strengthen the rule of law in the oil sector.
"The cleanup of the Niger Delta provides an ideal opportunity for Nigeria, the oil industry, and the international community to show convincingly that a new age has dawned."
"From now on, sustainable development must not be a mere slogan, but rather an operational approach to global governance and well-being on a strained and crowded planet."
Remembering Sri Lanka’s Killing Field
NEW YORK – One of the worst atrocity crime stories of recent decades has barely registered in the world’s collective conscience.
"We remember and acknowledge the shame of Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia, and Darfur."
We agonize about the failure to halt the atrocities being committed almost daily in Syria.
"But, at least until now, the world has paid almost no attention to war crimes and crimes against humanity comparable in their savagery to any of these: the killing fields of Sri Lanka in 2009."
"Three years ago, in the bloody endgame of the Sri Lankan government’s war against the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, some 300,000 civilians became trapped between the advancing army and the last LTTE fighters in what has been called “the cage” – a tiny strip of land, not much larger than New York City’s Central Park, between sea and lagoon in the northeast of the country."
"With both sides showing neither restraint nor compassion, at least 10,000 civilians – possibly as many as 40,000 – died in the carnage that followed, as a result of indiscriminate army shelling, rebel gunfire, and denial of food and medical supplies."
"The lack of outrage mainly reflects the Sri Lankan government’s success in embedding in the minds of policymakers and publics an alternative narrative that had extraordinary worldwide resonance in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001."
"What occurred in the cage, according to this narrative, was the long-overdue defeat, by wholly necessary and defensible means, of a murderous terrorist insurrection that had threatened the country’s very existence."
"The other key reason behind the world’s silence is that the Sri Lankan government was relentless in banning independent observers – media, NGOs, or diplomats – from witnessing or reporting on its actions."
And this problem was compounded by the timidity of in-country United Nations officials in communicating such information as they had.
"President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s government claimed throughout, and still does, that it maintained a “zero civilian casualties” policy."
"Officials argued that no heavy artillery fire was ever directed at civilians or hospitals, that any collateral injury to civilians was minimal, and that they fully respected international law, including the proscription against execution of captured prisoners."
"But that narrative is now being picked apart in a series of recent publications, notably the report last year of a UN Panel of Experts, and in two new books: UN official Gordon Weiss’s relentlessly analytical The Cage: The Fight for Sri Lanka and the Last Days of the Tamil Tigers, and BBC journalist Frances Harrison’s harrowingly anecdotal Still Counting the Dead: Survivors of Sri Lanka’s Hidden War."
"Nobody underplays the LTTE’s contribution to the 2009 savagery; but, with the Tigers’ leaders all dead, international attention should now be focused overwhelmingly on holding the government accountable for its failure to accept its responsibility to protect its own people."
"For far too long, Rajapaska’s government has been evading accountability with an endless stream of diversionary maneuvers (usually involving committees of inquiry intended to lead nowhere, and duly complying), denial of physical access, outright dissimulation, and relentless verbal intimidation of anyone daring to question it."
"Real international pressure is at last being placed on the government to explain its actions, most significantly by the much-maligned UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, which will consider Sri Lanka’s response in March 2013."
"In doing so, it is likely to be armed with a full brief of evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity now being compiled from eyewitness accounts by the Australian-based International Crimes Evidence Project."
"One of the most tragic aspects of the whole story, just now emerging, is the failure of UN officials on the ground to publicize at the time, when it really mattered, credible information that would have undercut the government’s narrative."
"Specific estimates of casualties in the combat area were compiled by a UN team in Colombo from early 2009, based on regular radiophone contact with a handful of reliable sources – NGO, medical, and local UN Tamil staff – still on the ground."
"The information was incomplete, but it was solid – and alarming."
But an institutional decision was taken not to use this information on the grounds that it could not be “verified.”
The real reasons are now emerging.
"In part, the UN team wanted to keep humanitarian assistance lines open."
"The team was also subjected to shameless verbal bullying by Sri Lankan officials (a deeply unpleasant experience to which I, too, have been subjected)."
"The team’s members also knew that Sri Lanka’s government had wide support among UN member states, and that the LTTE had none at all."
"But, as the Lakhdar Brahimi Panel concluded a decade ago, after reviewing some of the catastrophic failures of peace processes in the 1990’s, the responsibility of the UN Secretariat must be to tell the UN Security Council what it needs to hear, not what it wants to hear."
"An internal review panel studying what went wrong in the UN system’s response to Sri Lanka, commissioned by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and headed by the distinguished diplomat Charles Petrie, is due to report to Ban next month."
All indications are that it will not be a pretty story.
It is crucial that its findings be made public and acted upon.
Selective memory is a defense mechanism with which we are all familiar.
"For governments and international organizations, as with individuals, moral failure is easier to live with if we can pretend that it never happened."
"But mass atrocity crimes did happen in Sri Lanka, there was moral default all around, and if we do not learn from this past, we will indeed be condemned to repeat it."
Accounting for Gaza
New York – This week the United Nations Human Rights Council will debate the report of the fact-finding mission led by Judge Richard Goldstone on human rights violations in the Gaza conflict.
Let us hope it is a full and fair examination based on the report’s findings and recommendations.
"Goldstone and his team concluded that both Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian group controlling Gaza, committed war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity during the period of the conflict which the investigation addressed. The report calls for credible investigations of alleged rights violations  and recommends that the UN Security Council require both sides to report back within six months on the results, including any prosecutions they will carry out in connection with the violations identified."
"Failure to do so, in the view of Goldstone’s commission, should result in the Security Council referring the matter to the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court in The Hague."
"Unfortunately, rather than debating Goldstone’s detailed findings and the merits of his recommendations on ways to move forward, there are indications that governments may focus instead on the process leading up to the investigation and seek to limit full discussion of the report."
"As someone involved in that process, I feel it is important to put my views on record, as comments I made previously are now being used as part of the effort to undermine Judge Goldstone and his important work."
"I refused to accept the invitation from the president of the Human Rights Council at the time, Ambassador Martin Uhomoibhi of Nigeria, to lead the investigation following the Human Rights Council’s January 12, 2009 resolution. As a former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, I felt strongly that the Council’s resolution was one-sided and did not permit a balanced approach to determining the situation on the ground."
"It referred only to “the grave violations of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly due to the recent Israeli military attacks,” and called for a mission to investigate “all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law by the occupying power, Israel, against the Palestinian people.”"
I was also aware that the UN Human Rights Council had made repeated condemnations of Israel over the past two years but had focused little attention on large-scale violations of human rights in other countries.
This pattern of action and inaction by the Council has given greater credence to those who believe the UN’s highest human rights body is inherently anti-Israel.
I decided I could not undertake the mission for these reasons.
"I am aware that Judge Goldstone, a dedicated and unimpeachable human rights lawyer and advocate, shared similar concerns when he was initially approached."
But he was able to work with the Council’s president to secure an agreement he felt confident would permit the mandate to be interpreted in such a way as to allow his team to address the actions taken by
Experts can debate whether this was in conformity with UN rules and procedures.
I have no doubt that those involved were seeking a way forward that would allow for a full investigation and help overcome the political divisiveness currently undermining the Human Rights Council within the UN system.
"The question now is whether governments will give Judge Goldstone’s findings the serious attention they deserve, or instead fall back into an overtly political posture."
As Goldstone's report makes clear:
"Both the Palestinians and the Israelis are legitimately angered at the lives that they are forced to lead: For the Palestinians, the anger about individual events – the civilian casualties, injuries and destruction in Gaza following from military attacks, the blockade, the continued construction of the Wall outside of the 1967 borders – feed into an underlying anger about the continuing Israeli occupation, its daily humiliations and their as-yet-unfulfilled right to self-determination."
"For the Israelis, the public statements of Palestinian armed groups celebrating rocket and mortar attacks on civilians strengthen a deep-rooted concern that negotiation will yield little and that their nation remains under existential threat from which only it can protect its people."
"In this way, both the Israelis and the Palestinians share a secret fear – for some, a belief – that each has no intention of accepting the other’s right to a country of their own."
This anger and fear are unfortunately ably represented by many politicians. (Para.
"For the sake of human rights and peace in the region, my hope is that the international community will bear witness to these circumstances, consider Judge Goldstone’s report in its entirety and press for accountability for the most serious crimes."
Accounting Tricks Around the Globe
"Accounting chicanery will be high on the agenda of the bankers who will meet at the annual IMF/World Bank gathering in Washington, D.C. The IMF should do more than offer the private sector advice about how to fix its accounting problems; governmental accounting tricks and the IMF's own wheezes should also be addressed, says Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz."
The Arthur Anderson and Enron scandals in America have focused attention on the problems of accounting in private businesses.
"But the scale of this corruption should not blind us to the problem of public sector accounting, where many deceitful things are also being done."
"Accounting rules are designed to provide standardized frameworks within which the financial position of a firm, or government, can be assessed."
"Bad accounting frameworks always lead to bad information, and bad information leads to bad decisions, with serious long term consequences."
This is true in the public as well as the private sector.
America's business scandals showed how accounting rules can be bent and abused to provide a misleading picture of what is really happening in a company.
"The Bush Administration, not to be left behind, has shown how public accounting rules can be bent so as to provide a misleading picture of what is really happening in a national economy."
"Indeed, last year saw what may be the largest accounting fraud ever conducted, as a mega-surplus of more than $3trillion for the years 2002 to 2011 was transformed into a $2 trillion deficit."
"Investors in Enron waited years before discovering that something was amiss. Though sudden and vast, the change in America's fiscal stance already provides a clear inkling that something was amiss."
It will be years before the full magnitude of President Bush's deception is apparent.
"Meanwhile, the Bush Administration will blame the sinking economy, bad luck, and unintentional miscalculations for the vanished surplus."
But America is not alone in allowing for official accounting shenanigans.
"In Latin America and elsewhere in the developing world, the IMF imposes accounting frameworks that not only make little sense, but result in excessive austerity."
"In some of the poorest countries in the world - ie, those most dependent on aid - the IMF has argued that foreign aid should not be listed as revenue in a government's budget calculations."
But what else is aid if it is not revenue?
The IMF's argument seems to be this: a country cannot rely on foreign aid because aid is too unstable.
"The truth, of course, is that aid is more stable than tax revenues in poor countries."
"By the IMF's logic, neither aid nor tax revenues should be included in budgets."
"If that is the case, every country in the world is in deep trouble."
The absurdity here is the idea that all foreign aid should be added to reserves.
But donor countries want to see the money they give to finance schools or health clinics spent on schools and health clinics; they don't want to see it added to a nation's reserves.
Governments in developing countries have the
"Other IMF accounting practices, including how the capital expenditures of government-owned enterprises are treated, are also causing outrage. If a state owned enterprise"
But by
A second IMF accounting distortion involves stabilization funds.
"These are national funds that, in boom years, receive revenues from sales of natural resources to be set aside against a rainy day."
This makes sense.
But IMF accounting inhibits the use of these funds to help stabilize an economy through counter-cyclical fiscal spending.
"According to Mexican and Chilean officials I have discussed the matter with, spending from a stabilization fund is reportedly treated as if the country is borrowing, thus adding to its deficit."
"It is, of course, in times of economic downturn that countries worry most about their credit rating, so the IMF stance is particularly unhelpful."
"IMF accounting frameworks, rather than providing useful signals to the market, provide distorted information that exacerbates a troubled country's problems."
Good decisions require
A Centerless Euro Cannot Hold
"CAMBRIDGE – With youth unemployment touching 50% in eurozone countries such as Spain and Greece, is a generation being sacrificed for the sake of a single currency that encompasses too diverse a group of countries to be sustainable?"
"If so, does enlarging the euro’s membership really serve Europe’s apparent goal of maximizing economic integration without necessarily achieving full political union?"
The good news is that economic research does have a few things to say about whether Europe should have a single currency.
"The bad news is that it has become increasingly clear that, at least for large countries, currency areas will be highly unstable unless they follow national borders."
"At a minimum, currency unions require a confederation with far more centralized power over taxation and other policies than European leaders envision for the eurozone."
What of Nobel Prize winner Robert Mundell’s famous 1961 conjecture that national and currency borders need not significantly overlap?
"In his provocative American Economic Review paper “A Theory of Optimum Currency Areas,” Mundell argued that as long as workers could move within a currency region to where the jobs were, the region could afford to forgo the equilibrating mechanism of exchange-rate adjustment."
"He credited another (future) Nobel Prize winner, James Meade, for having recognized the importance of labor mobility in earlier work, but criticized Meade for interpreting the idea too stringently, especially in the context of Europe’s nascent integration."
"Mundell did not emphasize financial crises, but presumably labor mobility is more important today than ever."
"Not surprisingly, workers are leaving the eurozone’s crisis countries, but not necessarily for its stronger northern region."
"Instead, Portuguese workers are fleeing to booming former colonies such as Brazil and Macau. Irish workers are leaving in droves to Canada, Australia, and the United States."
"Spanish workers are streaming into Romania, which until recently had been a major source of agricultural labor in Spain."
"Still, if intra-eurozone mobility were anything like Mundell’s ideal, today we would not be seeing 25% unemployment in Spain while Germany’s unemployment rate is below 7%."
"Later writers came to recognize that there are other essential criteria for a successful currency union, which are difficult to achieve without deep political integration."
"Peter Kenen argued in the late 1960’s that without exchange-rate movements as a shock absorber, a currency union requires fiscal transfers as a way to share risk."
"For a normal country, the national income-tax system constitutes a huge automatic stabilizer across regions."
"In the US, when oil prices go up, incomes in Texas and Montana rise, which means that these states then contribute more tax revenue to the federal budget, thereby helping out the rest of the country."
"Europe, of course, has no significant centralized tax authority, so this key automatic stabilizer is essentially absent."
"Some European academics tried to argue that there was no need for US-like fiscal transfers, because any desired degree of risk sharing can, in theory, be achieved through financial markets."
This claim was hugely misguided.
"Financial markets can be fragile, and they provide little capacity for sharing risk related to labor income, which constitutes the largest part of income in any advanced economy."
Kenen was mainly concerned with short-term transfers to smooth out cyclical bumpiness.
"But, in a currency union with huge differences in income and development levels, the short term can stretch out for a very long time."
"Many Germans today rightly feel that any system of fiscal transfers will morph into a permanent feeding tube, much the way that northern Italy has been propping up southern Italy for the last century."
"Indeed, more than 20 years on, Western Germans still see no end in sight for the bills from German unification."
"Later, Maurice Obstfeld pointed out that, in addition to fiscal transfers, a currency union needs clearly defined rules for the lender of last resort."
"Otherwise, bank runs and debt panics will be rampant."
"Obstfeld had in mind a bailout mechanism for banks, but it is now abundantly clear that one also needs a lender of last resort and a bankruptcy mechanism for states and municipalities."
"A logical corollary of the criteria set forth by Kenen and Obstfeld, and even of Mundell’s labor-mobility criterion, is that currency unions cannot survive without political legitimacy, most likely involving region-wide popular elections."
Europe’s leaders cannot carry out large transfers across countries indefinitely without a coherent European political framework.
"European policymakers today often complain that, were it not for the US financial crisis, the eurozone would be doing just fine."
"Perhaps they are right. But any financial system must be able to withstand shocks, including big ones."
Europe may never be an “optimum” currency area by any standard.
"But, without further profound political and economic integration – which may not end up including all current eurozone members – the euro may not make it even to the end of this decade."
A Century of Chinese Protest
The Global Economy’s New Path
"WASHINGTON, DC – Whether we like it or not, the world around us is in a state of constant change."
But recent economic trends suggest that this change may be shifting its direction in a fundamental way.
Consider the advanced economies.
"During the last two decades, economic growth in these countries was led by consumption – so much so that economic activity in these economies swung from investment to consumption by a total of 10 percentage points of GDP."
"As a result, in 2010 the share of consumption in their GDP had reached 81.6%."

"Meanwhile, emerging markets and developing economies provided almost a mirror image of this trend, raising their investment and boosting the supply of goods to the rest of the world at the cost of consumption in their own economies."
"By 2010, the share of consumption in their GDP had declined, from 73.4% to 67.1%."
"Looking forward, it is unlikely that the consumption share of GDP can increase further in advanced economies."
The main drivers of this increase were primarily financial engineering and wealth effects from strong asset prices.
Neither of these factors currently is at play to push consumption’s share of GDP higher.
But can the advanced economies’ consumption even be sustained at the current level?
Perhaps not.
"Current levels of consumption are associated with over-extended governments and households, whose debt levels remain high, implying that more savings are required."
Banks also need to raise capital.
"In general, many economic agents need an extended period of deleveraging."
"However, current policies in the major advanced economies are aimed at maintaining current consumption levels in order to support growth and employment."
"If the consumption share of GDP nonetheless declines, simple arithmetic tells us that investment and exports need to be higher to maintain total demand."
Should we expect emerging markets and developing economies to pick up the slack?
"To sustain strong growth in these economies as external demand weakens, domestic demand needs to become the major engine of growth."
This means stronger domestic consumption and appropriate levels of investment to support such consumption growth.
"In economies where investment levels are leading to excess capacity, resources could shift from investment to consumption, provided that these countries’ external accounts remain sustainable."
"These are major tectonic shifts in the structure of the global economy, and are fraught with potential dangers."
"The pace of change will vary between sectors and across economies, leading to mismatches of demand and supply worldwide."
"Moreover, with globalization, an economic problem in one part of the world can be transmitted to the rest of the world more strongly, substantially complicating policy responses in both advanced and developing economies."
"A study of such spillover effects by the International Monetary Fund suggests that, before the global financial crisis, external factors explained 36% of change in output in the five systemically important economies (the eurozone, the United States, China, Japan, and the United Kingdom); after the crisis, however, this share reached close to 60%."
"In the rest of the world, including emerging markets, the share of external factors in output change increased from about 43% to more than 60%."
"In this environment, we must diligently pursue policy coordination at the global level."
"To achieve an orderly realignment of consumption and investment worldwide, policies that boost investment in one part of the world should match policies that boost consumption in other parts."
"In particular, advanced economies should implement fundamental productivity-enhancing reforms, the eurozone should strengthen the currency union, and emerging market and developing economies should boost their domestic sources of growth."
And these policies should be consistent with fiscal and external stability.
"Moreover, financial-sector policies and regulatory frameworks should be coordinated at the global level, in order to design and implement consensus-based rules – thereby addressing the problems posed by very large, global institutions that are considered too big or too complex to fail."
"Only with such global coordination can we reduce, and possibly eliminate, economic instability and disorderly adjustments both at home and abroad, even as we seek to maximize the benefits of the inevitable changes in the global economy."
Achieving a “Europe of Results”
BRUSSELS – The tsunami that has swept across financial markets is a global catastrophe.
"If handled correctly, however, the crisis may yet raise the esteem of the European Union and its institutions."
"The EU’s legitimacy problem has two different aspects: apathy, leading to a low turnout in the European parliamentary elections, and outright euro-skepticism."
"The voter-turnout problem partly reflects frustration about the present state of the EU, and also people’s impression that they can exert little influence by voting one way or the other."
"Euro-skepticism, on the other hand, and the looming threat of anti-European populism, is directly linked to the idea that the EU is not merely incapable of offering a solution to the crisis, but in fact is part of the problem."
"So, although the EU represents our best hope of ensuring that Europe is internationally competitive in today’s increasingly difficult environment, it is actually being blamed for globalization."
"Many people confuse these two aspects of the EU’s legitimacy problem, and believe that somehow turnout in European elections can be increased by pointing out to people how good and important the EU is. But in most cases, this is not possible."
"At first sight, the easiest answer to the problem of low voter turnout is to give more power to the European Parliament."
"But if this was the solution, then we would not have had steadily declining turnouts since the high point of 63%, at the first elections to the European Parliament in 1979."
"After all, since then the EP’s influence and powers of joint decision-making have grown constantly."
"The trouble is that, EP elections must be “about” something if voters are to be interested, which means they must involve a real choice."
And a real choice requires Europe-wide election campaigns by all parties.
This would also involve making the choice of the European Commission’s president dependent on the outcome of the EP elections.
"But, in fact, both of these conditions have already been met; in 2004, Portuguese Prime Minister José Manuel Durão Barroso was appointed President of the Commission because he came from the political organization with the strongest election result, the European People’s Party."
And this year’s elections saw a more intensive presence of party organizations at European level than ever before.
"Instead, I believe that the most important way to reawaken voters’ interest in European elections will be to open up the election of the Commission’s President to them, and create a genuinely Europe-wide political debate during the next election campaign."
"The Euro-skepticism problem can be tackled only if the Union itself starts to perform better, and is seen to be doing so."
"That is why in the aftermath of the failed referenda four years ago in France and the Netherlands on the Constitutional treaty, the Commission tried to emphasize the idea of a “Europe of Results” that would seek to convince citizens of its worth through concrete achievements."
"Given the gravity of the economic crisis, the time has come for the EU to demonstrate its strengths whenever possible."
"The aim must be not only to win back the hearts of Europeans who have become skeptical, but also to convince them that the Union is indispensable to meeting the challenges Europeans face."
Europe’s citizens understand that the relatively small nation-states that make up the EU are no longer able to face these enormous challenges on their own.
"In Ireland, last autumn’s financial crisis provoked a turnaround in public opinion about the EU, and even in Iceland, although it lies on the periphery of our continent, membership of the EU and the euro have become a priority."
European countries have become so interconnected that isolated national measures on issues like financial-market regulation are hopeless.
A changing world in which new powers like China and India play an increasingly important role will not wait for Europe to make up its mind.
The EU must instead show leadership through its efforts to solve the world’s current problems.
"As for the European People’s Party, for us the economy is not an end in itself but should serve the people."
The economic crisis was caused by shortsightedness and a lack of control in the global financial system.
"Now we must redefine the role of regulators in financial markets and in the wider economy, for we cannot let the financial sector walk off with the profits and leave taxpayers bearing the losses."
"That doesn’t mean that we are advocating a move to socialism; we want better and smarter regulation, not regulation for its own sake."
We see five keys to recovery:
A “Europe of Results” is achievable.
"It can strengthen the EU’s legitimacy, though, only if policy recommendations such as these, and the successes that result from implementing them, are communicated clearly and effectively to the general public."
Achieving Growth in a Rebalanced World
"MILAN – Although the financial crisis is winding down, the prospects for growth in the global economy are unlikely to pick up."
"This is, in part, inevitable."
But it is also the result of poor coordination between governments as the world economy rebalances.
"Prior to the crisis, American consumers, on average, either saved nothing or accumulated debt."
That has now changed.
"With household wealth seriously damaged by the housing crash and other asset-price declines, pensions and retirement provisions are in disarray."
"Because asset prices will not reach pre-crisis levels anytime soon (that is, without inflating another bubble and risking renewed instability), household saving in the United States has risen to about 5% of disposable income, and probably will rise further."
This withdrawal of the US consumer is part (perhaps half) of the process of rebalancing the global economy.
Restoring America’s savings-investment balance implies a reduction in global aggregate demand of around $800 billion.
"To be sure, fiscal deficits and emergency measures in advanced economies and some major developing countries have cushioned the sharp decline, substituting in part for missing consumers."
But this substitution cannot continue indefinitely.
"In advanced countries, governments will eventually be forced to reduce spending, and central banks will withdraw from emergency credit provisions and guarantees."
"As a result, many believe that a “new normal” of slower advanced-country growth is upon us."
"Despite a recovery in asset prices in many countries and the deceleration of negative growth, unemployment is high and rising."
"Risk spreads have declined from their mid-crisis highs, but credit in many sectors remains tight or barely available, while the financial sector is set to become more conservative – and is likely to be re-regulated with higher capital, reserve, and margin requirements."
And this is just the baseline scenario.
"Downside risks include fiscal destabilization resulting from a failure to rein in deficits, inflation and withdrawal of central bank autonomy, and loss of confidence in the dollar, which continues to be the reserve currency for the global economy."
"Little wonder, then, that many knowledgeable analysts reasonably expect post-crisis growth in advanced countries to be lower, perhaps by 0.5 to 1%."
"A 1% slowdown in advanced-country growth translates into roughly $350 billion of missing aggregate demand every year, in addition to the shortfall because of rebalancing in the US."
"If the slowdown in advanced countries persists, pre-crisis growth levels will not be achievable in the developing world either, owing to insufficient demand to absorb the implied increase in output."
"Of course, individual developing countries may be spared."
But it is an unfortunate mathematical fact that not everyone can gain market share.
"If the advanced-country scenario is right, many developing countries will lose out and experience sharply diminished growth."
"Prior to the crisis, many suspected that the mix of aggregate demand that was supporting high growth was unsustainable, though the problem perhaps seemed too hypothetical to compel collective action."
Not anymore.
"But the collective action problem is no less daunting, and it requires urgent attention if the world’s growth aspirations are to be achieved."
"The problem is all the more pressing because countries can achieve gains in market share not only through higher private-sector competitiveness, but also by means of protectionist measures."
"And, as we have seen in many countries’ efforts to ameliorate the crisis, the non-cooperative protectionist response is much more likely to be adopted – despite wide recognition that it is highly destructive – when aggregate demand is in short supply."
"So what can be done to shore up global aggregate demand and growth prospects, while preserving the economic openness that has benefited major parts of the developing world so greatly in the past 30 years?"
"First, countries with current-account surpluses such as Germany, Japan and China must recognize that their own growth (and that of others) depends on reducing the global savings-investment imbalance, which will result in narrowing external deficits elsewhere."
This needs to be done on a sustained basis following the withdrawal of extraordinary fiscal stimulus.
"Second, everyone must recognize their stake in restoring balanced advanced-country growth as much and as soon as possible in order to counter the ongoing shortfall in aggregate demand."
"After all, advanced countries account for about two-thirds of global GDP, so slow growth in these countries will inevitably impede global growth and truncate the growth potential of much of the developing world."
"This challenge, however, is very complex because deleveraging and rebalancing cannot be completed overnight."
"But key steps can and should be taken: restoration of fiscal balance in well-communicated plans, commitment to central bank autonomy and low inflation, and striking a thoughtful balance between under- and over-regulation of the financial sector."
"Externally, major trading partners and holders of advanced-country assets can support rebalancing by agreeing to avoid sudden and potentially destabilizing shifts in the composition of their balance sheets."
"So, two crucial items must claim priority at the top of the world’s economic agenda in the months ahead."
The first is re-regulation of advanced countries financial systems with a view to ensuring greater stability without impairing essential functions or unnecessarily elevating the cost of capital.
The second is a set of understandings and commitments among the major advanced and developing countries to rebalance the global economy in order to restore aggregate demand and growth.
"If that can be accomplished, the world will have taken a major step toward a relatively smooth, effective, and equitable global economic recovery."
A Chinese Champion of Peace and Freedom
"PRAGUE – On Christmas Day last year, one of China’s best-known human rights activists, the writer and university professor Liu Xiaobo, was condemned to 11 years in prison."
"Liu is one of the main drafters of Charter 08, a petition inspired by Czechoslovakia’s Charter 77, calling on the Chinese government to adhere to its own laws and constitution, and demanding the open election of public officials, freedom of religion and expression, and the abolition of “subversion” laws."
"For his bravery and clarity of thought about China’s future, Liu deserves the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize."
There are two reasons why we believe that Liu would be a worthy recipient of that prestigious award.
"First and foremost, he stands in the tradition of Nobel Peace Prize laureates who have been recognized for their contribution to the struggle for human rights. Nobel laureates such as Martin Luther King, Lech Walesa, and Aung San Suu Kyi are but a few of the many examples that the Nobel Committee has recognized in previous years."
We are convinced that the concepts that Liu and his colleagues put down on paper in December 2008 are both universal and timeless.
"These ideals – respect for human rights and human dignity, and the responsibility of citizens to ensure that their governments respect those rights – represent humanity’s highest aspirations."
"Should the Nobel Committee choose to recognize Liu’s courage and sacrifice in articulating these ideals, it would not only draw global attention to the injustice of Liu’s 11-year sentence."
It would also help to amplify within China the universal and humanistic values for which Liu has spent so much of his life fighting.
The second reason why Liu deserves the Nobel Peace Prize resonates with Alfred Nobel’s original intent for the award.
"In working to promote human rights, political reform, and democratization in China, Liu has made a significant contribution to the values of peace and fraternity among nations that Nobel had in mind when he created the award more than a century ago."
"Of course, democratization does not automatically guarantee better behavior on the world stage. But it does facilitate a full and rigorous public debate over key questions of a state’s foreign and domestic policies."
"This active and searching conversation, the hallmark of a democratic polity, is the best hope for better decisions by governments, both at home and abroad."
"Liu’s committed advocacy on behalf of democracy in China is, above all, intended for the benefit of the Chinese people. But his courage and example may help to accelerate the dawn of the day when China’s participation in international affairs is aided by the expertise and oversight of civil-society groups, an independent media, and an engaged citizenry able to express its views through the ballot box."
It is primarily for these two reasons that we believe that Liu would be a worthy recipient of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize.
"In conferring on Liu one of the world’s highest honors, the Committee would be signaling once again the importance of human rights and democracy on the one hand, and world peace and international solidarity on the other."
"Liu’s harsh prison sentence was meant as an exemplary measure, a stern warning to all other Chinese who might want to follow his path."
"We are convinced that there are moments when exemplary civic engagement, such as Liu’s, requires an exemplary response."
Awarding him the Nobel Peace Prize is precisely the response that his courage deserves.
A Civilization in Crisi
A Clarion Call for Emerging Market
"ITHACA – With 2012 underway, it is worth reflecting on how a decade of strong economic growth in emerging markets led to last year’s resounding political transformations."
"From the dramatic events in the Middle East, to the groundswell of support for the anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare in India, leaders in emerging markets are getting a clear message from the streets that growth is not everything."
They ignore this message at their peril.
"Emerging-market economies delivered solid growth during the 2000’s, and even survived the global financial crisis without a growth collapse. But the specter of rising corruption is compromising the legitimacy of their economic gains and eroding support for further reforms needed to sustain their growth momentum."
"Corruption takes many forms, but, in emerging markets, a combination of factors has turned it into a cancer that ultimately topples regimes."
"Relentless low-level corruption is a major irritant for poor people in many of these countries; indeed, it limits their access to the social services and basic government functions that they often depend upon for their very survival."
Another type of corruption involves siphoning enormous sums of money from large-scale projects.
"In India, for example, the government lost as much as $30-40 billion of much-needed revenue when coveted band spectrum was sold through a rigged auction."
"For ordinary people, large-scale corruption is less visible, because, while the sums involved are mind-boggling, the costs are not as directly felt as they are in the case of lower-level graft. But the perception of this type of mega-corruption has changed as rapid growth has increased inequality."
"In countries like China and India, rapid economic growth has lifted a huge number of people out of poverty. But the fruits of globalization and rapid growth have not been evenly shared – the rich become super-rich, even as a large fraction of the population remains destitute."
"Rising income inequality is hardly limited to emerging markets, but their combination of open corruption and pervasive inequities creates a toxic brew that is undermining support for reforms that would strengthen and consolidate their economic gains."
"In many emerging markets, a lack of political freedom adds to the combustible mix."
"The combination of corruption, inequality, and political repression builds up enormous pressure, and there are no institutional channels through which to release it."
But freer political regimes are not a panacea.
"In a democracy like India’s, the politically well-connected benefit from skewed growth, thus increasing the resentment of those left behind."
"The opportunity to “throw the rascals out” in each election cycle helps to let off some steam, but it does not resolve the problems that are generating it."
"It is difficult to predict what triggers popular protest, but economic factors are key."
"For example, rising food prices tend to hurt the poor, especially the urban poor, who spend a large share of their income on food; unlike agricultural workers, they receive none of the benefits of higher food prices."
"With swelling urban populations, it will become increasingly difficult to keep a lid on these pressures."
"Some governments have reacted to recent events with political repression, information blackouts, or a combination of authoritarian measures."
"China, for example, blocked media coverage of the Egyptian protests."
"The Arab Spring, however, reveals the fragility of repressive political regimes that try to maintain their legitimacy by limiting information flows."
The main lesson for dynamic emerging-market countries is that an exclusive focus on GDP growth may ultimately not be good for economic and political stability.
"Even with rapid increases in national income, if these countries’ leaders do not distribute the benefits fairly, they will become vulnerable to popular discontent."
Tackling corruption is critical to improving long-term growth and maintaining social stability.
"These economies need measures that help to keep the poor out of poverty traps, and that give them realistic opportunities to improve their economic well-being."
"Such steps include broadening financial markets to give more people access to credit and investment, strengthening social safety nets to protect the economically vulnerable, and improving educational access and quality."
"These lessons apply equally to advanced economies, which also suffer from rising inequality and subtle forms of corruption. But, for those wealthy economies, restoring decent growth is now the major priority."
Emerging markets have a golden opportunity to build on their economic gains and lock in growth and stability by tackling deep-seated problems like corruption.
"As the past year’s events have shown, the costs of inaction could be calamitous."
A Clockwork Chemistry
"OXFORD – In Anthony Burgess’s novella (and Stanley Kubrick’s film) A Clockwork Orange, Alex, an unrepentant psychopath, has his eyes pried wide open and is forced to watch violent images."
"Like Pavlov’s dog, Alex is being programmed to respond with nausea to violence and sex."
"This scene remains shocking, but, like most science fiction, it has aged."
"The behaviorist psychology it drew upon has long expired, and the fear that science will be used to make, or even force, people to be morally better now sounds old-fashioned."
"Science fiction ages fast, but it has a long afterlife."
"Over the past decade, an army of psychologists, neuroscientists, and evolutionary biologists has been busy trying to uncover the neural “clockwork” that underlies human morality."
"They have started to trace the evolutionary origins of pro-social sentiments such as empathy, and have begun to uncover the genes that dispose some individuals to senseless violence and others to acts of altruism, and the pathways in our brain that shape our ethical decisions."
And to understand how something works is also to begin to see ways to modify and even control it.
"Indeed, scientists have not only identified some of the brain pathways that shape our ethical decisions, but also chemical substances that modulate this neural activity."
A recent study has shown that the anti-depressant Citalopram can change the responses of individuals to hypothetical moral dilemma scenarios.
Individuals given the drug were less willing to sacrifice an individual to save the lives of several others.
"Another series of studies has shown that when the hormone oxytocin is administered via nasal spray, it increases trusting and cooperative behavior within social groups, but also decreases cooperation with those perceived as outsiders."
"Neuroscientists have even magnetically “zapped” carefully targeted areas of people’s brains to influence their moral judgments in surprising ways – for example, making it easier for them to lie."
"Of course, no one is developing a “moral pill” that will transform us into saints."
"But the research is advancing fast, and it is almost certain to suggest new ways to reshape our moral intuitions, sentiments, and motivations."
Should we use our growing scientific understanding of the basis of human morality to try to make people morally better?
"A Clockwork Orange was accused of glorifying violence, and some of its scenes are still hard to watch."
"But as Burgess himself argued, the novella has an almost Christian message: what makes us human is our freedom to choose both good and evil, and for society to crush individuals into servile conformity is as wicked as, and perhaps even worse than, the sadism of psychopaths like Alex."
"I suspect that many will agree with this view. They will agree that our ability to distinguish right from wrong is something precious that we should safeguard, not a broken clock that scientists should fix."
"Of course, most of us don’t need to be conditioned to feel repulsed by rape or torture."
"But this does not mean that we are morally good, or good enough."
"As you read this, perfectly ordinary people somewhere in the world are doing unspeakable things to others."
"Even in the most advanced and affluent societies, a vast concentrated effort is needed to preserve even minimal decency: think of locks, security alarms, police, courts, and prisons."
"And it is doubtful that we really care enough about others, or give enough to the less fortunate."
"Humans are born with the capacity to be moral, but it is a limited capacity which is ill equipped to deal with the ethical complexities of the modern world."
"For thousands of years, humans have relied on education, persuasion, social institutions, and the threat of real (or supernatural) punishment to make people behave decently."
"We could all be morally better, but it is clear that this traditional approach cannot take us much further."
"It is not as if people would suddenly begin to behave better if we just gave them more facts and statistics, or better arguments."
"So we shouldn’t be too quick to dismiss the suggestion that science might help – in the first instance, by helping us design more effective institutions, more inspiring moral education, or more persuasive ethical arguments."
But science might also offer more direct ways of influencing our brains.
Science fiction sometimes limits rather than expands our sense of what is possible.
"It would be self-defeating, or worse, to try to promote morality through brutal coercion."
"Governments must not be given the power to control its citizens’ moral code – we know that if they had such power, they would misuse it."
"It would be ideal if individuals could freely explore different ways to improve themselves, whether by practicing mindfulness, reading moral philosophy, or, yes, by taking a ’morality’ pill."
"But it is also true that although some people are eager to take pills that make them feel better or think faster, it is not so obvious that people would really want to take pills that would make them morally better."
It is not clear that people really want to be morally better.
"And those who, like the psychopathic Alex, need the most help are probably those who would want it least."
"These are, of course, hypothetical questions."
We don’t yet know what is possible. But it is better to begin the ethical discussion too early than too late.
"And even if “moral pills” are just science fiction, they raise deep questions."
Will we want to take them if they ever become available?
And what does it say about us if we won’t?
A Cloud over Airplane Safety
"PRINCETON – When airports across Europe reopened after the closure caused by the eruption of Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull volcano, it was not because the amount of ash in the atmosphere had dropped, but because the risk that the ash posed to airplane safety had been reassessed."
"Was it new scientific information that led to the lifting of the flight ban, or was it a reflection of the hardship, both personal and economic, that the ban was causing?"
"Over six days, about 95,000 flights were canceled, at a cost to airlines of more than $1 billion."
An estimated five million people were stranded or delayed.
"The British economy lost £1.5 billion, and others were similarly affected."
"Flower growers in Kenya, who depend on air transport to take their short-lived product to Europe, suddenly had no income."
Sixteen cancer patients in critical need of bone marrow for transplants were put at risk because the matching marrow could not be flown in from the United States or Canada.
"In the past, jets flying into ash from volcanoes in the US, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Mexico have temporarily lost engine power, and in one case, dropped thousands of feet, although all managed to land safely."
But there was no evidence that the more widely dispersed ash blowing over Europe from Iceland would cause similar problems.
"The decision to ground flights was based on the view that any level of ash in the atmosphere posed some risk to aircraft, and that no matter how slight that risk might be, the government’s job was, as British Prime Minister Gordon Brown put it, “to make sure that safety was paramount.”"
"Indeed, in closing their skies, European governments seem to have given safety absolute priority over everything else."
Yet none of them act on that principle in other areas.
"Some 3,000 people die on the world’s roads every day."
"Cutting speed limits to, say, 10 kilometers per hour would prevent most accidents and save many lives."
"We don’t do it, because we give safety a lower priority than our desire to spend less time driving."
The price we are willing to pay for safety cannot be infinite.
"It is distasteful to put a price on human life, but the more we spend on safety, the less we will have for our other goals."
"The British government uses a figure of a little more than £1 million as a general limit to the amount it is prepared to pay to save a statistical life – for example, by improving road safety."
"In the US, the Department of Transportation is prepared to go up to $5.8 million – nearly four times as much, at current exchange rates – for the same purpose."
"Does that mean that safety is paramount in the US, but not in Britain?"
"Giovanni Bisignani, the head of the International Air Transport Association, an industry group, criticized the shutdown, saying that no risk assessment had been undertaken."
"On the whole, though, the public seemed to support the decision."
"Stranded travelers, interviewed at airports, typically said that they would rather be stuck at an airport than in a plane falling out of the sky."
"But what if some travelers have a higher tolerance of risk, or just a more urgent need to travel, than others?"
"John Stuart Mill, in his classic book On Liberty, considered a situation in which a man sets out to cross a bridge that we know is unsafe."
"In Mill’s view, we are justified in stopping him only to make sure that he is aware of the danger."
"Once he knows of it, the decision is his to make, because only he can judge the importance of his journey, and balance that against the risk he is running."
"Air safety is slightly different, because a crashing plane can kill people on the ground, but the greatest risks by far are borne by the passengers and crew."
"If they are fully informed of the risks, and are still willing to fly – perhaps the crew has been offered more money, as workers in dangerous occupations often are – should we prevent them from making the decision to fly?"
"In the end, after test flights with no passengers aboard had shown no engine damage, and aircraft engine manufacturers told aviation authorities that their engines could operate safely with a low level of ash in the atmosphere, Europe’s skies were reopened."
The International Civil Aviation Authority has announced that it will convene a group of experts to help it provide guidance for the industry to decide what level of ash in the atmosphere makes it unsafe to fly.
"Now that we have seen the costs of giving absolute priority to safety, we know that this is not only a technical question."
I trust that among the experts will be some who have pondered the underlying ethical question: how safe should we aim to be?
A Communist Party without Communism
PRINCETON – Russian President Vladimir Putin’s anointment of Alexander Medvedev to succeed him in what is supposed to be a democratic presidential election next March shows that Russia’s leaders have not changed a whit.
"It looks increasingly likely that, as under Leonid Brezhnev, we will see the same names in the news for decades to come."
"According to Gleb Pavlovsky, the Putin regime’s leading ideologist, the current Russian system is perfect in all respects but one: it doesn’t know its enemies."
"Indeed, it seems as if everyone in the Kremlin is reading Carl Schmitt, the Nazi legal theorist who taught that naming your enemy is the central mission of politics."
"In the spirit of Schmitt, Putin’s men designated a liberal party, the Union of Right Forces, as their ur-enemy."
Its public meetings were broken up by armed police; its leaders arrested and beaten;
Putin called its supporters “coyotes.”
What is surprising is that this aggressive behavior occurred in response to no visible danger.
"Oil prices are soaring, as are Putin’s approval ratings."
"His appointees control everything that matters, from Gazprom to the Central Electoral Committee."
"Since the pacification of Chechnya with violence and subsidies, the incarceration or emigration of a few financially viable opponents, and the massive “social investments” of recent years, which, under Medvedev’s personal supervision, have bribed the population, no credible force can seriously challenge Putin’s men."
"Yet their regime is in crisis, and they know it."
Russia’s economy is more dependent on gas and oil than ever before.
Military reform has been reversed.
"Despite increasing incomes, Russians are less educated and less healthy than they were when Putin came to power; they still die at a shockingly young age."
Russian involvement in world affairs is tainted by poison and corruption.
State monopolies undo what private businesses created.
"With more money, ill-educated bureaucrats hire more ill-educated bureaucrats; as a result, the regime fails to rule the country."
"The country is unruly, and its rulers know it."
So they panic.
Putin’s aim was to subject all power to the control of Russia’s security forces.
"His generation of KGB officers watched the collapse of the Communist Party and all the governmental bodies that it “directed and controlled,” including the KGB."
"Under Putin, the security service has had its revenge."
"Its people have become powerful, arrogant, and enormously rich."
They have also become disobedient.
"In 2004, General Viktor Cherkesov, then Putin’s representative in northwest Russia, published an essay that glorified the KGB as the only unspoiled authority in a corrupted country."
"This essay, more than anything else, defined Putin’s second term."
"In October 2007, Cherkesov (now chief of one of the most obscure and powerful services, the Federal Anti-Drug Administration) published another essay in which he lamented his colleagues’ degradation: warriors had turned into traders, he complained."
"Earlier, generals from a competing service, the FSB, had arrested Cherkesov’s deputy for “illegal bugging.”"
"In a public gesture of despair, Cherkesov admitted the failure of Putin’s project to reanimate Russian governance by subordinating it to the security services."
Cherkesov’s deputy remains in prison.
Most believe that Putin is unable to intervene in his defense.
"In the absence of Communist Party control, these security officers betrayed their corporate ethic and engaged in horse-trading, applying force when a trade did not go well."
That this happens to ordinary Russians is clear; what Cherkesov revealed was that Putin’s circle also confronts this situation.
What is to be done when ex-KGB warriors turn their swords and bugs against one another?
Cherkesov’s case exemplifies Putin’s nightmare.
"But if your instincts betray you, you go back to even deeper ones."
"Now that Putin’s people have left their predecessors’ neo-liberal ideas behind and feel disenchanted with the ex-KGB clique, the task is to recreate an omnipresent political party that controls the security services, the administration, business, and much else."
This party will be centralized under personal leadership and will reduce the state to a legal fiction.
"Preaching nationalism, its managers will believe in their universal competence, as opposed to KGB-style professionalism and corporatism."
Boris Yeltsin forbade party cells in state-controlled institutions by decree.
"Putin’s lawyers will reverse that decision; the party will have cells or committees in every factory, corporation, military unit, university department, etc. Integrated by the leader’s charisma and party discipline, party members will direct and unify the desolated country."
This is Putin’s plan.
"Like former Soviet leader Yuri Andropov, the only other KGB man to rule Russia, Putin will become the party’s general secretary."
"As in the Soviet era, state and governmental officials will be reduced to party ciphers – the role that President Medvedev will play under General Secretary Putin."
"And, of course, being General Secretary carries no constitutional term limit."
"In the end, Putin has what history left him: not ideas, just a faction yearning to consolidate its grip on power."
Lenin and Trotsky needed a party to make their ideology a reality;
Putin and Medvedev are devising an ideology to solidify their party.
It is a bizarre ideology.
"Accusing warriors of being traders and traders of being thieves, it shuns its Marxist origins."
"It will subordinate all who really do work – traders, warriors, journalists, and others – to party ideologues whose sole job is to search for enemies."
A Confederal Solution for Palestine
"LONDON – Last month, while in New York City, I happened to be staying in the same hotel as Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu."
"To accommodate his security needs, the hotel had been converted into a fortress, much like Israel itself."
Netanyahu was in the United States for yet another round of Middle East peace talks.
The US offered various sweeteners to induce Israel to freeze its West Bank settlement construction for another 90 days.
The Israelis refused; another impasse was reached.
"What, then, might be the prospects of a negotiated peace between two peoples with claims to the same land?"
The answer is: very poor.
"All peace efforts since the Oslo accords of 1993 have been based on the “two-state solution,” according to which Israel is supposed to turn over the occupied territories to a Palestinian state, the Palestinians are supposed to renounce any claims on the Jewish state, and everyone is supposed to live happily ever after."
A negotiated “land for peace” solution still remains official Western doctrine.
"As US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton put it in a recent speech, “a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace” has to be based on “two states for two peoples.”"
"Meanwhile, the two main parties to the dispute, Palestine and Israel, are searching for unilateral alternatives to the stymied “peace process.”"
"The Palestinians are pushing for international recognition of their statehood, while the Israelis are using their settlement policy to preempt a Palestinian state."
"Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said that, if the latest peace talks collapse, he will press for UN recognition of a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders."
"This month, Brazil and Argentina recognized “Palestine,” and a cascade of Latin American countries is expected to follow."
"Abbas is now setting his sights on Europe, and would ask Turkey to serve as a go-between."
The game is to use international recognition of an independent Palestinian state to pressure the US to retreat from its almost unconditional support for Israeli policy.
Israel’s main concern continues to be security.
The official Western doctrine is that Israel’s long-term security depends on the success of the “peace process.”
"In practice, Israel has been taking other measures to secure its future."
"Media attention has been focused on the “security wall,” which has certainly succeeded in reducing the level of violence."
"But, to the hawks who now control Israeli politics, the key to Israel’s security depends on depth of defense, for which expansion of the settlements is indispensable."
"The hawks’ recipe for survival is threefold: continued military and economic support from the US, defensible frontiers through a strategic settlement program, and the carve-up of the Palestinian West Bank into disconnected bantustans, or subordinate authorities, incapable of concerted opposition to Israeli policy."
"Thus, while Abbas seeks to create a new “fact on the ground” by drumming up international support for a Palestinian state, Israel aims to trump him by making such a state unviable."
"The ideal alternative to both strategies is a peace process that aims not to create two states, but rather to establish the political and economic basis for a single confederal state."
"Indeed, the two-state solution was always an illusion."
"There was never enough land to satisfy the passionate possessiveness of all those with claims to it. And, over time, Israeli settler disengagement from the West Bank and East Jerusalem has become just as impossible as any attempt by Israel to expel its remaining Arabs."
"Israeli Jews are bound to stay in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Israeli Arabs are bound to stay in Israel proper."
These are the “facts on the ground” that doom Palestinian hopes for a sovereign Palestinian state no less than Israeli hopes for a wholly Jewish state.
"Moreover, land for peace never made sense from an economic point of view."
"If compensation for wrongs to the Palestinians was to be the guiding principle, there were always better ways of going about it than to found a rickety, poverty-ridden new country dependent on foreign aid."
"Most people have forgotten that the Paris Protocols of April 1994 established a customs union between Israel and the occupied territories, with a joint Economic Council to adjudicate trade disputes."
"The free movement of goods, labor, and capital between the two parts could have given a tremendous economic boost to Palestinian GDP."
"It could also have been the basis of a confederal state, whose Palestinian part would have benefited from the West Bank settlers’ productivity and taxes. But this benign prospect was undermined by the violence needed to maintain the Jewish state and enable the emergence of a Palestinian one."
"The official view remains that only an internationally guaranteed two-state settlement will bring about the security needed for the economic revival of the Palestinian territories. But it is just possible that unilateral Israeli policy, implicitly backed by the US, will create interim conditions of peace that are sufficient for economic growth to cool Palestinian nationalism."
"The Palestinian cause is not the overriding preoccupation of even the Arab states, so Netanyahu’s strategy of defense in depth stands a better chance of success than Abbas’s pursuit of statehood through international recognition."
"Netanyahu’s project is not moral. But that doesn’t mean that it won’t work, at least for a time."
A Confederation for Kosovo
Time is running out in Kosovo.
"If a United Nations-backed settlement is not reached by early December, the province’s majority Albanian population is likely to declare independence unilaterally – a move that the United States has announced it may support."
That would be a disastrous step.
"Russia would be furious, because it fears that Kosovo’s secession – whether or not it is internationally recognized – might fuel separatist movements in the former Soviet empire."
Serbia is even more strongly opposed.
"Dusan Prorokovic, Serbia’s state secretary for Kosovo, has said that his country might use force to maintain its sovereignty."
"Even if the government hesitates, ultranationalist groups might push Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica to send in troops: the current UN presence in Kosovo is very thin (only 40 “military observers” and 2,116 policemen) but the stationing of 15,000 NATO troops could make any armed clash very dangerous."
"After eight years of international administration, Kosovo’s Albanian majority has tasted freedom and is eager for full independence."
But Serbia claims that the province remains an essential part of its historical and cultural tradition.
"Moreover, independence would not be accepted by the Serbian public, which has already watched in dismay as “Great Serbia” has been gradually whittled away, most recently with the secession of Montenegro."
"Serbia is prepared to concede only “enhanced autonomy” to Kosovo, and some capacity to enter into international agreements."
"Yet, while the two parties now seem irreconcilable, it is not too late for compromise."
But this is possible only by resuscitating – and updating – an old institution of the international community: a confederation of states.
"By means of a binding UN Security Council resolution, Kosovo could be granted full and exclusive authority over its citizens and territory, as well as limited capacity for action on the international scene."
"It could be authorized to enter into trade agreements as well as agreements concerning individuals (for example, admission and circulation of foreigners, or extradition), plus the right to seek admission to the UN (which does not require full sovereignty and independence)."
Kosovo would thus gain some essential trappings of statehood.
"However, a decision-making body consisting of delegates from Kosovo, Serbia, and the European Union would be given full authority over major foreign policy issues (for example, alliances and relations with international economic institutions), defence, borders (in case Kosovo wished to join with Albania), and the treatment of Kosovo’s Serbian minority."
"As a result, Kosovo and Serbia would constitute two distinct international subjects, bound by a confederation hinging on a common decision-making body."
"Of course, this confederation would be asymmetrical, because the Serbian government’s sovereignty over the rest of Serbia would remain intact and unlimited, whereas the Kosovar government’s “sovereignty” over Kosovo would be restrained."
"To avoid one of the two parties getting the upper hand and imposing arbitrary decisions, the common decision-making body should consist of four Serbian delegates, two Kosovar delegates, and three representatives of the EU, thus requiring both sides to gain the support of the European delegates."
"In addition, the EU should create a small but effective military force (say, 5,000 troops) to back up the common body’s decisions."
"As with any compromise, the contending parties would both gain and lose from this arrangement."
"Serbia would save face, and would continue to have a say on crucial matters concerning Kosovo, including the treatment of the Serbian minority."
"Kosovo would acquire limited independence, with its status rising from a province of a sovereign state to an international subject capable of entering into certain agreements with other states and even joining the UN."
"The EU would benefit as well, by contributing to the stabilization of a highly volatile area."
"Subsequently, the EU would monitor Kosovo and prevent any dispute that might turn violent."
A final advantage of this solution is that it would be temporary.
"Historically, confederations sooner or later either become federations (as occurred in the US, Germany, and Switzerland) or, pushed by centrifugal forces, split up (as with the United Arab Republic, established in 1958, which split three years later into Egypt and Syria)."
"The confederation I advocate would thus constitute an intermediate stage (lasting five or ten years), at the end of which Kosovo is likely to become fully independent."
"Delaying a final solution in this way would provide time to verify Kosovo’s prospects of joining the EU and thus eventually sharing “sovereign authority” with other independent states, which could deflate Kosovars’ dangerously robust nationalistic demands."
A Conservative Europe
"Last week Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac, and Gerhard Schroeder met in Berlin."
They departed pledging to revive Europe's growth.
We've heard that empty promise before.
"Instead, the European Union needs a new direction."
I say this as leader of the party which has been at the forefront of Britain's engagement with Europe.
It was a Conservative government that first applied for membership in the early 1960's.
A Conservative government took the United Kingdom into the European Economic Community in 1973.
Margaret Thatcher worked with Jacques Delors to forge the Single Market in 1986.
So I have no doubt that Britain must remain influential within the Union. But British policy towards the EU has often led to worse rather than better relations among member states.
"Faced with a new EU initiative, our traditional response has often been to oppose it, vote against it, lose the vote, then sulkily to adopt it while blaming everyone else."
Many Europeans are sick of British vetoes. So am I.
Of course there are basic requirements that all member states must accept.
"Foremost are the four freedoms of the single market; free movement of goods, services, people and capital."
"But a single market does not require a single social or industrial policy, far less a common taxation policy."
Allowing countries to pursue their own policies in these areas encourages competitiveness.
Forcing common standards means that Europe will fall further behind as member states shuffle their costs onto their neighbours.
"Which areas should be applied to every member state, and which should be optional?"
I believe that every member state should administer those policies that do not directly and significantly affect other member states.
"In areas which serve their national interest, individual members should decide whether to retain wholly national control or whether to co‑operate with others."
The Union's members should form a series of overlapping circles: different combinations of members should be able to pool their responsibilities in different areas of their own choosing.
Precedents exist for this.
NATO has been flexible since its inception.
France signed up for membership but later refused to submit her armed forces to NATO's central command.
"Similar flexibility exists with the Euro, the Schengen Agreement, and the Social Chapter."
These precedents can be extended.
"So far, everyone has had to move forward together, with individual countries negotiating specific opt‑outs. But since 1998, there has been a procedure within the Treaties - called enhanced co‑operation - that could allow some members to go ahead with further integration in a specific area without involving every other member."
"Instead of individual member states having fraught negotiations to opt‑out of a new initiative, those that support it can simply opt‑in."
Countries that want to integrate further can do so.
They don't need to drag Britain and others kicking and screaming in their wake because the others are not compelled to join them.
In this way we can break free of the institutionalised tug of war that has characterised EU relations.
I am not talking about a two‑speed Europe.
That implies that we all agree on the destination and differ only about the speed of the journey.
I don't want to reach the destination that some of our partners may aspire to. But I don't want to block their way.
There are some who say that this would mean a loss of influence on the part of those countries which choose not to integrate more closely. But influence is not an end in itself - it is a means to an end.
Britain does not need a seat at the table when decisions on the Euro are taken.
Our economy has not been adversely affected by staying out.
"Keeping the pound does not mean that we oppose the Euro, or hope for its failure."
The European Union should stop trying to do everything and concentrate on doing fewer things more effectively.
"It should give member states the chance to develop an approach to Europe that suits their national traditions, within the EU framework."
It is on this basis that British Conservatives oppose the proposed constitution.
"We disagree with many of its contents, of course, but also oppose the idea of having an EU constitution at all."
"There is a world of difference between an association of nation states bound together by treaty, and a single entity, whether you call it a state or not, with its own legal personality, deriving its authority from its own constitution."
"If this constitution were accepted in anything like the proposed form, the EU would gain many attributes and trappings of statehood: its own president and foreign minister, its own legal system."
The supremacy of EU law would derive not from Acts of national Parliaments but from a supra‑national constitution.
"That is a radical change, not the mere tidying‑up exercise some suggest."
I do not believe it is right to make a change of such magnitude without specifically consulting the people on whose behalf we govern.
Elected parliaments do not own our liberties.
"They safeguard them, and should not diminish those liberties without an explicit mandate."
Any proposal for a new constitution must be put to the British people and to the people in each EU member state.
A Conspiracy So Immense
NEW YORK – Is this the Age of the Conspiracy Theory?
"Plenty of evidence suggests that we are in something of a golden age for citizen speculation, documentation, and inference that takes shape – usually on the Internet – and spreads virally around the globe."
"In the process, conspiracy theories are pulled from the margins of public discourse, where they were generally consigned in the past, and sometimes into the very heart of politics."
I learned this by accident.
"Having written a book about the hijacking of executive power in the United States in the Bush years, I found myself, in researching new developments, stumbling upon conversations online that embrace narratives of behind-the-scenes manipulation."
There are some major themes.
"A frequent one in the US is that global elites are plotting – via the Bilderberg Group and the Council on Foreign Relations, among others – to establish a “One World Government” dominated by themselves rather than national governments."
"Sometimes, more folkloric details come into play, broadening the members of this cabal to include the Illuminati, the Freemasons, Rhodes Scholars, or, as always, the Jews."
The hallmarks of this narrative are familiar to anyone who has studied the transmission of certain story categories in times of crisis.
"In literary terms, this conspiracy theory closely resembles The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , featuring secretive global elite with great power and wicked aims."
"Historically, there tends to be the same set of themes: fearsome, uncontrolled transformative change led by educated, urbanized cosmopolitans."
"Students of Weimar Germany know that sudden dislocations and shocks – rapid urbanization, disruption of traditional family and social ties, loosening of sexual restrictions, and economic collapse – primed many Germans to become receptive to simplistic theories that seemed to address their confusion and offer a larger meaning to their suffering."
"Similarly, the “9/11 Truth Movement” asserts that al-Qaeda’s attack on the Twin Towers was an “inside job.”"
"In the Muslim world, there is a widespread conspiracy theory that the Israelis were behind those attacks, and that all Jews who worked in the buildings stayed home that day."
"Usually, conspiracy theories surface where people are poorly educated and a rigorous independent press is lacking."
So why are such theories gaining adherents in the US and other affluent democracies nowadays?
Today’s explosion of conspiracy theories has been stoked by the same conditions that drove their acceptance in the past: rapid social change and profound economic uncertainty.
A clearly designated “enemy” with an unmistakable “plan” is psychologically more comforting than the chaotic evolution of social norms and the workings – or failures – of unfettered capitalism.
"And, while conspiracy theories are often patently irrational, the questions they address are often healthy, even if the answers are frequently unsourced or just plain wrong."
"In seeking answers, these citizens are reacting rationally to irrational realities."
"Many citizens believe, rightly, that their mass media are failing to investigate and document abuses."
"Newspapers in most advanced countries are struggling or folding, and investigative reporting is often the first thing they cut."
"Concentration of media ownership and control further fuels popular mistrust, setting the stage for citizen investigation to enter the vacuum."
"Likewise, in an age when corporate lobbyists have a free hand in shaping – if not drafting – public policies, many people believe, again rightly, that their elected officials no longer represent them."
Hence their impulse to believe in unseen forces.
"Finally, even rational people have become more receptive to certain conspiracy theories because, in the last eight years, we actually have seen some sophisticated conspiracies."
"The Bush administration conspired to lead Americans and others into an illegal war, using fabricated evidence to do so."
"Is it any wonder, then, that so many rational people are trying to make sense of a political reality that really has become unusually opaque?"
"When even the 9/11 commissioners renounce their own conclusions (because they were based on evidence derived from torture), is it surprising that many want a second investigation?"
"Frequently enough, it is citizens digging at the margins of the discourse – pursuing such theories – who report on news that the mainstream media ignores."
"For example, it took a “conspiracy theorist,” Alex Jones, to turn up documentation of microwave technologies to be used by police forces on US citizens."
The New Yorker confirmed the story much later – without crediting the original source.
The mainstream media’s tendency to avoid checking out or reporting what is actually newsworthy in Internet conspiracy theories partly reflects class bias.
Conspiracy theories are seen as vulgar and lowbrow.
"So even good, critical questions or well-sourced data unearthed by citizen investigators tend to be regarded as radioactive to highly educated formal journalists."
"The real problem with this frantic conspiracy theorizing is that it leaves citizens emotionally agitated but without a solid ground of evidence upon which to base their worldview, and without constructive directions in which to turn their emotions."
This is why so many threads of discussion turn from potentially interesting citizen speculation to hate speech and paranoia.
"In a fevered environment, without good editorial validation or tools for sourcing, citizens can be preyed upon and whipped up by demagogues, as we saw in recent weeks at Sarah Palin’s rallies after Internet theories painted Barack Obama as a terrorist or in league with terrorists."
We need to change the flow of information in the Internet age.
"Citizens should be able more easily to leak information, pitch stories, and send leads to mainstream investigative reporters."
"They should organize new online entities in which they pay a fee for direct investigative reporting, unmediated by corporate pressures."
"And citizen investigators should be trained in basic journalism: finding good data, confirming stories with two independent sources, using quotes responsibly, and eschewing anonymity – that is, standing by their own bylines, as conventional reporters do."
This is how citizens can be taken – and take themselves – seriously as documenters and investigators of our common situation.
"In a time of official lies, healthy investigative energy should shed light, not just generate heat."
A Contagion of Bad Idea
"NEW YORK – The Great Recession of 2008 has morphed into the North Atlantic Recession: it is mainly Europe and the United States, not the major emerging markets, that have become mired in slow growth and high unemployment."
"And it is Europe and America that are marching, alone and together, to the denouement of a grand debacle."
"A busted bubble led to a massive Keynesian stimulus that averted a much deeper recession, but that also fueled substantial budget deficits."
"The response – massive spending cuts – ensures that unacceptably high levels of unemployment (a vast waste of resources and an oversupply of suffering) will continue, possibly for years."
The European Union has finally committed itself to helping its financially distressed members.
"It had no choice: with financial turmoil threatening to spread from small countries like Greece and Ireland to large ones like Italy and Spain, the euro’s very survival was in growing jeopardy."
"Europe’s leaders recognized that distressed countries’ debts would become unmanageable unless their economies could grow, and that growth could not be achieved without assistance."
"But, even as Europe’s leaders promised that help was on the way, they doubled down on the belief that non-crisis countries must cut spending."
"The resulting austerity will hinder Europe’s growth, and thus that of its most distressed economies: after all, nothing would help Greece more than robust growth in its trading partners."
"And low growth will hurt tax revenues, undermining the proclaimed goal of fiscal consolidation."
The discussions before the crisis illustrated how little had been done to repair economic fundamentals.
The European Central Bank’s vehement opposition to what is essential to all capitalist economies – the restructuring of failed or insolvent entities’ debt – is evidence of the continuing fragility of the Western banking system.
"The ECB argued that taxpayers should pick up the entire tab for Greece’s bad sovereign debt, for fear that any private-sector involvement (PSI) would trigger a “credit event,” which would force large payouts on credit-default swaps (CDSs), possibly fueling further financial turmoil."
"But, if that is a real fear for the ECB – if it is not merely acting on behalf of private lenders – surely it should have demanded that the banks have more capital."
"Likewise, the ECB should have barred banks from the risky CDS market, where they are held hostage to ratings agencies’ decisions about what constitutes a “credit event.”"
"Indeed, one positive achievement by European leaders at the recent Brussels summit was to begin the process of reining in both the ECB and the power of the American ratings agencies."
"Indeed, the most curious aspect of the ECB’s position was its threat not to accept restructured government bonds as collateral if the ratings agencies decided that the restructuring should be classified as a credit event."
The whole point of restructuring was to discharge debt and make the remainder more manageable.
"If the bonds were acceptable as collateral before the restructuring, surely they were safer after the restructuring, and thus equally acceptable."
"This episode serves as a reminder that central banks are political institutions, with a political agenda, and that independent central banks tend to be captured (at least “cognitively”) by the banks that they are supposed to regulate."
And matters are little better on the other side of the Atlantic.
"There, the extreme right threatened to shut down the US government, confirming what game theory suggests: when those who are irrationally committed to destruction if they don’t get their way confront rational individuals, the former prevail."
"As a result, President Barack Obama acquiesced in an unbalanced debt-reduction strategy, with no tax increases – not even for the millionaires who have done so well during the past two decades, and not even by eliminating tax giveaways to oil companies, which undermine economic efficiency and contribute to environmental degradation."
Optimists argue that the short run macroeconomic impact of the deal to raise America’s debt ceiling and prevent sovereign default will be limited – roughly $25 billion in expenditure cuts in the coming year.
"But the payroll-tax cut (which put more than $100 billion into the pockets of ordinary Americans) was not renewed, and surely business, anticipating the contractionary effects down the line, will be even more reluctant to lend."
The end of the stimulus itself is contractionary.
"And, with housing prices continuing to fall, GDP growth faltering, and unemployment remaining stubbornly high (one of six Americans who would like a full-time job still cannot get one), more stimulus, not austerity, is needed – for the sake of balancing the budget as well."
"The single most important driver of deficit growth is weak tax revenues, owing to poor economic performance; the single best remedy would be to put America back to work."
The recent debt deal is a move in the wrong direction.
There has been much concern about financial contagion between Europe and America.
"After all, America’s financial mismanagement played an important role in triggering Europe’s problems, and financial turmoil in Europe would not be good for the US – especially given the fragility of the US banking system and the continuing role it plays in non-transparent CDSs."
"But the real problem stems from another form of contagion: bad ideas move easily across borders, and misguided economic notions on both sides of the Atlantic have been reinforcing each other."
The same will be true of the stagnation that those policies bring.
A Cool Calculus of Global Warming
"The British government recently issued the most comprehensive study to date of the economic costs and risks of global warming, and of measures that might reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in the hope of averting some of the direst consequences."
"Written under the leadership of Sir Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics, who succeeded me as Chief Economist of the World Bank, the report makes clear that the question is no longer whether we can afford to do anything about global warming, but whether we can afford not to."
"The report proposes an agenda whose cost would be equivalent to just 1% of annual consumption, but would save the world risk equivalent costs that are five times greater."
"The reported costs of global warming are higher than in earlier studies because it takes into account the mounting evidence that the process of global warming is highly complex and non-linear, with a non-negligible chance that it may proceed much faster than had previously been thought and that the extent of warming may be much greater than had previously been thought."
"Indeed, the study may actually significantly underestimate the costs: for instance, climate change may lead to more weather variability, a possible disappearance or major shift of the Gulf Stream – of particular concern to Europe – and a flourishing of disease."
"When I served in 1995 on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the scientific group that periodically assesses the science of global warming, there was overwhelming evidence that the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere had increased markedly since the beginning of the industrial revolution, that human activity had contributed significantly to those increases, and that they would have profound effects on climate and sea levels. But few saw, for instance, the Artic ice cap melting as rapidly as now seems to be the case."
"Still, some suggest that because we are not certain about how bad global warming will be, we should do little or nothing."
"To me, uncertainty should make us act more resolutely today, not less."
"As one scientist friend puts it: if you are driving on a mountain road, approaching a cliff, in a car whose brakes may fail, and a fog bank rolls in, should you drive more or less cautiously?"
Global warming is one of those rare instances where the scientific community is more fearful of what may be happening than the population at large.
Scientists have glimpsed what the future may portend.
"As the Stern report points out, as usual, the poor are the most vulnerable."
A third of Bangladesh will be underwater by the end of this century.
The Maldives and a host of Pacific Island states will disappear: our twenty-first-century Atlantis.
"To an economist, the problem is obvious: polluters are not paying the full costs of the damage they cause."
Pollution is a global externality of enormous proportions.
"The advanced countries might mean Bangladesh and the disappearing island states no harm, but no war could be more devastating."
"A global externality can best be dealt with by a globally agreed tax rate. This does not mean an increase in overall taxation, but simply a substitution in each country of a pollution (carbon) tax for some current taxes."
"It makes much more sense to tax things that are bad, like pollution, than things that are good, like savings and work."
"Although President George W. Bush says he believes in markets, in this case he has called for voluntary action. But it makes far more sense to use the force of markets – the power of incentives – than to rely on goodwill, especially when it comes to oil companies that regard their sole objective as maximizing profits, regardless of the cost to others."
"Exxon has reportedly been funding so-called think tanks to undermine confidence in the science of global warming, just as the tobacco industry funded “research” to question the validity of statistical findings showing the link between smoking and cancer."
"Some companies even seem to celebrate the melting of the polar ice cap, because it will reduce the cost of extracting the oil that lies beneath the Arctic Ocean."
The good news is that there are many ways by which improved incentives could reduce emissions – partly by eliminating the myriad of subsidies for inefficient usages.
"The US subsidizes corn-based ethanol, and imposes tariffs on sugar-based ethanol; hidden in the tax code are billions of dollars of subsidies to the oil and gas industries."
"Most importantly, price signals that show the true social costs of energy derived from fossil fuels will encourage innovation and conservation."
"Small changes in practices, when replicated by hundreds of millions of people, can make an enormous difference."
"For example, simply changing the color of roofs in warm climates to reflect sunlight or planting trees around houses can lead to great savings on energy used for air conditioning."
"We have but one planet, and should treasure it."
Global warming is a risk that we simply cannot afford to ignore anymore.
A Crisis in Full Flight
"MUNICH – For a while, it looked as if the European Central Bank’s €1 trillion credit program to pump liquidity into Europe’s banking system had calmed global financial markets."
"But now interest rates for Italian and Spanish government bonds are on the rise again, closing in on about 6%."
"Of course, this may not be the breaking point beyond which the debt burden becomes unsustainable."
"After all, interest rates in Southern Europe were well above 10% in the decade before the euro was introduced."
Even Germany at that time had to pay bondholders more than 6%.
"Nevertheless, the markets are clearly signaling growing doubt about whether Spain and Italy will be willing to bear their debt burden."
"The main problem is Spain, where private and public-sector foreign debt is larger than that of Greece, Portugal, Ireland, and Italy combined, and, as in Greece, is in the neighborhood of 100% of GDP (93% to be precise)."
"A quarter of the labor force and half of Spain’s youth are unemployed, reflecting the country’s loss of competitiveness in the wake of the real-estate bubble inflated by cheap euro credit in the pre-crisis period."
"The current-account deficit remains at 3.5% of GDP, despite the recession-induced decline in imports, while economic contraction will cause Spain to miss its budget-deficit target again."
"Moreover, Spain’s debt with the ECB’s TARGET settlement system rose by €55 billion ($72 billion) between February and March, because capital outflows of that amount had to be compensated."
"Since July 2011, Spain’s TARGET debt has grown by €199 billion."
"Capital is in full flight, more than offsetting the inflows from 2008-2010."
The cumulative total since the beginning of the first crisis year (2008) means that Spain has financed its entire current-account deficit via the printing press.
"The picture is little better in Italy, where the current-account balance has swung from a surplus of around 2% of GDP to a 3%-of-GDP deficit over the last ten years."
"The country’s TARGET debt grew by €76 billion from February to March, with the total since July 2011 reaching €276 billion."
"Italy, too, is being drained of capital; in fact, the flight of investors accelerated after the ECB’s liquidity injection."
"It is now clear that the ECB itself has caused a large part of the capital flight from countries like Spain and Italy, because the cheap credit that it offered drove away private capital."
The purpose of the ECB’s measures was to re-establish confidence and bring about a recovery of the inter-bank market.
"In this, too, it has not really been successful, despite the huge amount of money that it put on the table."
"Indeed, now the French are looking wobbly."
"As capital fled the country between July 2011 and January 2012, France’s TARGET debt increased by €95 billion."
"France, too, has become uncompetitive, owing to the cheap credit brought by the euro in its initial years."
"According to a recent study by Goldman Sachs, the country’s price level must drop by an estimated 20% vis-à-vis the euro average – that is, depreciate in real terms – if the economy is to regain competitiveness within the eurozone."
"Italy will have to depreciate by 10-15%, and Spain by roughly 20%."
"While Greece and Portugal face the need for deflation totaling 30% and 35%, respectively, the figures for Spain and Italy are high enough to justify fears about the future development of the eurozone."
"These imbalances can be redressed only with great effort, if at all, and only if one accepts a decade of stagnation."
"For Greece and Portugal, staying in the eurozone will be a tight squeeze."
"There are many who would solve the problem by routing more and more cheap credit through public channels – bailout funds, eurobonds, or the ECB – from the eurozone’s healthy core to the troubled South."
But this would unfairly force savers and taxpayers in the core countries to provide capital to the South on terms to which they would never voluntarily agree.
"Already German, Dutch, and Finish savings amounting to €15,000, €17,000, and €21,000, respectively, per working person have been converted from marketable investments into mere equalization claims against the ECB."
No one knows what these claims will be worth in the event of a eurozone breakup.
"Above all, however, the permanent public provision of cheap credit would ultimately lead to a lingering infirmity, if not to Europe’s economic collapse, because the eurozone would become a central management system with state control over investment."
"Such systems cannot work, because they eliminate the capital market as the economic system’s main steering mechanism."
One cannot help but wonder how thoughtlessly Europe’s politicians have started down this slippery slope.
A Crisis of Trust
"LONDON – Public trust in financial institutions, and in the authorities that are supposed to regulate them, was an early casualty of the financial crisis."
"That is hardly surprising, as previously revered firms revealed that they did not fully understand the very instruments they dealt in or the risks they assumed."
It is difficult not to take some private pleasure in this comeuppance for the Masters of the Universe.
"But, unfortunately, if this loss of trust persists, it could be costly for us all."
"As Ralph Waldo Emerson remarked, “Our distrust is very expensive.”"
The Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow made the point in economic terms almost 40 years ago: “It can be plausibly argued that much of the economic backwardness in the world can be explained by the lack of mutual confidence.”
"Indeed, much economic research has demonstrated a powerful relationship between the level of trust in a community and its aggregate economic performance."
"Without mutual trust, economic activity is severely constrained."
"Even within Europe, there is powerful evidence that countries where mutual trust is higher achieve higher levels of investment, particularly through venture capital investment, and are prepared to use more flexible contracts, which are also beneficial for growth and investment."
"So if it is true that trust in financial institutions – and in the governments that oversee them – has been damaged by the crisis, we should care a lot, and we should be devising responses which seek to rebuild that trust."
"In fact, the evidence for a crisis of trust is rather difficult to interpret."
"In the United Kingdom, recent survey results are ambiguous."
"Surveys promoted by financial firms tend to show that trust in them has not diminished much, and that people continue to trust them even more than they do the National Health Service or the BBC."
Surveys promoted by the BBC tend to show the reverse.
"Banks quote statistics to show that they are more trusted than supermarkets, whereas supermarkets cite evidence that the opposite is true, and are expanding into financial services in the belief that the public will trust them more than they trust the banks, which have had to be expensively bailed out by the government."
The market will prove one side right before too long.
"In the United States, there is now a more systematic, independent survey promoted by economists at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business."
"Their financial trust index, based on a large-scale survey of financial decision-makers in American households, did show a sharp fall in trust in late 2008 and early 2009, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers."
"That fall in confidence affected banks, the stock market, and the government and its regulators."
"Furthermore, the survey showed that declining trust was strongly correlated with financial behavior."
"In other words, if your trust in the market and in the way it is regulated fell sharply, you were less likely to deposit money in banks or invest in stocks."
So falling trust had real economic consequences.
"Fortunately, the latest survey, published in July this year, shows that trust in banks and bankers has begun to recover, and quite sharply. This has been positive for the stock market."
There is also a little more confidence in the government’s response and in financial regulation than there was at the end of last year.
"The latter point, which no doubt reflects the Obama administration’s attempts to reform the dysfunctional system it inherited, is particularly important, as the sharpest declines in investment intentions were among those who had lost confidence in the government’s ability to regulate."
It would seem that rebuilding confidence in the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission is economically more important than rebuilding trust in Citibank or AIG.
"Continuing disputes in Congress about the precise details of reform could, therefore, have an economic cost if a perception that the system will not be overhauled gains ground."
All these data are at an aggregate level and reflect average views among voters and investors.
Yet we also know that individual views are remarkably heterogeneous.
"Some people are very trusting of others, and of the firms and institutions with which they do business."
Others are congenitally distrustful.
Researchers at the European University Institute in Florence and UCLA recently demonstrated that there is a relationship between trust and individuals’ income.
"A pan-European opinion survey, which has been carried out for many years, allows us to relate the two."
It asks simple but powerful questions about how far individuals are inclined to trust those with whom they deal.
"The data show, intriguingly, that those who show levels of trust well below the average for the country they live in are likely to have lower incomes."
Is that just because low-income people feel that life is unfair and therefore distrust those around them?
"It would seem not, as it is also true that very trusting people also have lower incomes than the average."
"In other words, if you diverge markedly from society’s average level of trust, you are likely to lose out, either because you are so distrustful of others that you miss out on opportunities for investment and mutually beneficial exchange, or because you are so trusting that you leave yourself open to being cheated and abused."
When anyone I don’t know says “trust me” – an irritating conversational tic – I usually close my wallet.
"Perhaps most academics, who are at the lower end of the skill and qualification-adjusted income scale, do the same."
Maybe we should trust each other more – but not too much.
A Crisis of Understanding
"NEW HAVEN – Few economists predicted the current economic crisis, and there is little agreement among them about its ultimate causes."
"So, not surprisingly, economists are not in a good position to forecast how quickly it will end, either."
"Of course, we all know the proximate causes of an economic crisis: people are not spending, because their incomes have fallen, their jobs are insecure, or both."
"But we can take it a step further back: people’s income is lower and their jobs are insecure because they were not spending a short time ago – and so on, backwards in time, in a repeating feedback loop."
"It is a vicious circle, but where and why did it start?"
Why did it worsen?
What will reverse it? It is to these questions that economists have been unable to offer clear answers.
The state of economic knowledge was just as bad in the Great Depression that followed the 1929 stock market crash.
"Economists did not predict that event, either."
"In the 1920’s, some warned about an overpriced stock market, but they did not predict a decade-long depression affecting the entire economy."
"Late in the Great Depression, in August 1938, an article by Ralph M. Blagden in"
"The causes given were “distributed widely among government, labor, industry, international politics and policies.”"
"They included misguided government interference with markets, high income and capital gains taxes, mistaken monetary policy, pressures towards high wages, monopoly, overstocked inventories, uncertainty caused by the reorganization plan for the Supreme Court, rearmament in Europe and fear of war, government encouragement of labor disputes, a savings glut because of population shrinkage, the passing of the frontier, and easy credit before the depression."
"Although economic theory today is much improved, if we ask people about the cause of the current crisis, we will mostly get the same answers."
"We would certainly hear some new ones, too: unprecedented real-estate bubbles, a global savings glut, international trade imbalances, exotic financial contracts, sub-prime mortgages, unregulated over-the-counter markets, rating agencies’ errors, compromised real-estate appraisals, and complacency about counterparty risk."
"More likely than not, many or most of these people would be mostly or partly right, for the economic crisis was caused by a confluence of many factors, the chance co-occurrence of a lot of bad things, which pushed the financial system beyond its breaking point."
"At that point, the trouble grabbed widespread attention, destroyed public confidence, and set in motion a negative feedback loop."
"Our attention, after all, is naturally drawn to the worst events."
"Consider the question of predicting events like the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti, which killed more than 200,000 people."
It captured our attention because it was so bad in terms of lives and property damage.
"But if one went beyond trying to predict the occurrence of earthquakes to predicting the extent of the damage, one could surely devise a long list of contributing factors – including even political, financial, and insurance factors – that resembles the list of factors that caused the global economic crisis."
"Indeed, the crisis knows no end to the list of its causes. For, in a complicated economic system that feeds back on itself in many ways, events that start a vicious cycle might be as seemingly trivial as the proverbial butterfly in the Amazon, which, by flapping its wings, sets off a chain of events that eventually results in a far-away hurricane."
"Chaos theory in mathematics explains such dependency on remote and seemingly trivial initial conditions, and explains why even the extrapolation of apparently precise planetary motion becomes impossible when taken far enough into the future."
"Weather forecasters cannot forecast far into the future, either, but at least they have precise mathematical models."
Massive parallel computers are programmed to yield numerical solutions of differential equations derived from the theory of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. &nbsp;
"Scientists appear to know the mechanism that generates weather, even if it is inherently difficult to extrapolate very far."
The problem for macroeconomics is that the types of causes mentioned for the current crisis are difficult to systematize.
"The mathematical models that macroeconomists have may resemble weather models in some respects, but their structural integrity is not guaranteed by anything like a solid, immutable theory."
"The most important new book about the origins of the economic crisis, Carmen Reinhart’s and Kenneth Rogoff’"
"This leaves us trying to use patterns from past, dissimilar crises to try to infer the likely prognosis for the current crisis."
"As a result, we simply do not know if the recovery will be solid or disappointing."
Financing the Next Development Agenda
"WASHINGTON, DC – As the 2015 target date for the Millennium Development Goals approaches, the United Nations is intensifying its efforts to foster debate about what comes next for promotion of development worldwide."
"The outcome of these discussions will shape policies and investment aimed at spurring GDP growth, strengthening human capital, and promoting more inclusive prosperity."
"With the global population expected to reach nine billion people by 2050 – a significant proportion of whom will reside in developing or underdeveloped countries – the international community must improve access to education, health care, and employment opportunities worldwide."
"Meanwhile, the prospect of a rise in global temperature of more than 2°C (3.6°F) over pre-industrial levels by the end of this century (which would trigger global warming’s most damaging effects) calls for higher investment in sustainable urbanization, climate-smart agriculture, and social safety nets."
"Both factors challenge us to define, in the longer term, more sustainable patterns of production and consumption."
"Governments, civil society, and the private sector must rise to the challenge, cooperating to find and implement creative solutions."
"But, first, they must anticipate the associated financing requirements, which will soon surpass the current capacities of governments and international donors, and take action now to activate new, reliable sources of financing."
"To start, governments should design targeted, evidence-based policies and support the development of sound institutions."
"This would make government services more effective, while helping to catalyze additional development aid from traditional donors and mobilize private-sector resources."
"In many countries, there is considerable scope for domestic resource mobilization."
"Broadening the tax base, improving tax administration, and closing gaps in the value-added tax could make a significant difference in lower-income countries, where tax revenues account for only about 10-14% of GDP, compared to 20-30% of GDP in high-income countries."
"More equitable taxation would have a positive impact on governance, another important tool for mobilizing domestic resources."
"With improved corporate and public governance and clear transfer-pricing policies, resource-rich countries could shore up their capacity to negotiate fair contracts with extractive industries, balance revenues and expenditures over time, and manage their natural endowments more transparently."
Progress in these areas would help governments to channel their spending more effectively toward those who would benefit the most.
"For example, only 8% of the $409 billion spent on fossil-fuel subsidies in 2010 reached the poorest 20% of the population."
"A targeted support program could increase substantially the efficiency of spending, freeing up resources for education, health, and poverty eradication."
"Furthermore, promoting financial deepening and inclusiveness could accelerate private-sector growth, creating more opportunities."
"Indeed, broader access to financial services would help the estimated 400 million micro, small, and medium-size enterprises in developing countries to prosper, while enabling the 2.5 billion people worldwide who currently lack access to such services to build their assets."
A deeper and more efficient financial sector would also reduce transaction costs and facilitate risk management.
Local-currency bond markets could help to develop domestic investor bases and mobilize domestic savings to support long-term investments.
"At the same time, the international community should work to improve the availability and effectiveness of official development assistance."
"The ODA target of 0.7% of GDP – agreed in 2002 at the International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico – should motivate countries to increase their contributions."
They can also take steps to make ODA more predictable from year to year.
"Donors should structure aid to ensure that it supports sound national development policies and programs, rather than their own narrow interests."
"This is particularly relevant as emerging development partners, especially the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), offer new kinds of aid packages that incorporate investment and non-financial assistance."
"Private charities, which have been instrumental in promoting innovation in fields such as health care, the environment, and education, could provide valuable insight into channeling aid more effectively."
"More generally, improving coordination among donors would help to maximize the impact of aid on the ground."
"While ODA remains an important source of financing for fragile and very-low-income countries, it represents only 7% of net financial flows to developing countries, where foreign direct investment, remittances, long-term debt, and portfolio investment have a larger impact."
"Donors should leverage aid to “grow the pie” and to diversify financing sources for the world’s poorest countries by providing risk guarantees, innovative investment vehicles, debt syndication, and co-financing arrangements."
"Attracting even a fraction of the assets held by institutional investors, sovereign-wealth funds, and public pension funds could boost development finance substantially."
Diaspora populations are another major potential source of development financing.
"Reducing transfer costs, which average an estimated 9% of the value of transactions, would put more money into the hands of those who need it most."
"Tailoring financial products for diaspora communities could attract resources for investment, while reinforcing migrants’ ties – economic and otherwise – to their home countries."
"Finally, the international community bears a special responsibility for delivering global public goods."
"The responsibility to preserve the environment, stem the spread of communicable diseases, strengthen the international financial architecture, enhance developing-country participation in the global trading system, and facilitate the exchange of knowledge lies at the intersection of national development priorities and global interests."
"Duty-free, quota-free access to OECD markets, complemented by simpler, more transparent rules of origin, would raise GDP by 1% in the least-developed countries, lifting millions out of poverty."
"Investment in statistical capacity would help governments and businesses worldwide to make better policy decisions, based on a more accurate accounting of the associated costs and benefits."
"The challenge of the post-2015 development agenda lies in finding creative solutions to support prosperity, equality, and sustainability."
"Together, governments, civil society, international organizations, and the private sector can improve the availability and quality of finance for development, and shape a better future for all."
A Cure for Fiscal Failure?
CAMBRIDGE – Should more countries create independent fiscal advisory councils to infuse greater objectivity into national budget debates?
"Jailed swindler Bernie Madoff recently summed up a lot of people’s feelings about fiscal policy, declaring that “the whole government is a Ponzi scheme.”"
Perhaps this was just wishful thinking from a man who will die in prison after his own record-breaking $50 billion pyramid scheme collapsed in 2008.
"Personally, I suspect Madoff’s unenviable place in the record books will be secure for quite a while."
"Still, with many of the world’s largest governments facing a lethal combination of unsustainable conventional debt, unprecedented old-age pension obligations, and a downshift in growth, one has to wonder what the fiscal plan is."
"In a new paper, “A Decade of Debt,” Carmen M. Reinhart and I show that general government debt in the United States, including federal, state, and local debt, has now surpassed the record 120% of GDP reached at the end of World War II."
"Japan, of course, is in even worse shape, with government debt totaling more than 200% of GDP."
"Though this is partially offset by foreign-exchange reserves, Japan now faces massive disaster-relief costs – and this on top of its depressing demographic trends."
"Many other rich countries’ debt levels are also uncomfortably close to 150-year highs, despite relative peace in much of the world."
There is a no easy way out.
"For now, low world interest rates are restraining debt-service costs, but debt levels can be reduced only very gradually over long periods, whereas real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates can rise far more quickly, even for rich countries."
"Debt crises tend to come out of the blue, hitting countries whose debt trajectories simply have no room for error or unplanned adversity."
The single most immediate and direct impact of having an independent fiscal policy would be to reign in spending by producing a counterpoint to Panglossian government growth and revenue forecasts.
"In principle, an independent and respected advisory council could also force governments to acknowledge the hidden costs of government guarantees and off-balance sheet debts."
It is high time to consider novel approaches.
"Of course, no one simple change will eliminate the huge bias towards deficit spending in most modern political systems. And no one simple change will preclude the risk of future debt and inflation crises."
Many countries require sweeping reforms to make their tax systems more efficient and their entitlement programs – including their pension schemes – more realistic.
The recent advent of fiscal advisory councils is a promising institutional start.
"A number of countries, including Denmark, the Netherlands, the US, and Belgium, have long-standing fiscal watchdog agencies, such as the US Congressional Budget Office (CBO)."
"But, while these older institutions have proven enormously useful, they are typically quite constrained."
"The CBO, for example, is free to issue long-term fiscal projections based on its own best estimates of growth, but is largely forced to accept politically implausible future “fixes” at face value, somewhat neutralizing the potential effectiveness of any critique of deficit policies."
"To enhance credibility, a number of governments are gingerly moving towards creating fiscal councils with greater independence, often with central banks as a role model."
"The new vanguard includes councils in Sweden, the United Kingdom, Slovenia, and Canada."
"The remit of Sweden’s fiscal council is particularly broad, giving it a mandate not only to forecast, but also to look more deeply at the motivations and consequences of government policy."
"In principle, an independent fiscal council could have provided invaluable help during the financial crisis."
"In the US, such an agency could have weighed in on the costs and benefits of bailout plans, perhaps helping to end congressional paralysis and steeling nerves to give taxpayers more upside risk."
"It is too much to expect that these new fiscal institutions will become as important or powerful as central banks, at least anytime soon."
There is far more consensus over monetary policy than over fiscal policy. And fiscal policy is far more complex and multi-dimensional.
"Still, the general principle seems like an important step towards fiscal sanity."
"Of course, fiscal councils by themselves are not enough, no matter how well designed they are."
"It will remain very tempting for each generation to say, “My grandchildren will be two or three times richer than I, so who cares if they have to pay some debt?”"
"Moreover, the political cycle creates a very strong deficit bias, as leaders seek to embellish feelings of economic health and prosperity by raising visible expenditures at the cost of hidden debts and lower long-term investment."
"To resist these powerful pressures, fiscal councils will need to have their work audited periodically by international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund, both to protect their independence and to promote accountability."
"To be sure, Bernie Madoff may yet be proved right, and his will not turn out to be the biggest Ponzi scheme ever. But greater transparency and a more systematic independent evaluation of government policies could be a very helpful step towards solving the perpetual conundrum of outsized deficits."
It is certainly one of the more innovative and promising ideas to emerge from a rather barren policy landscape.
A Customs Union for the Balkan
"The fall of Milosevic does not cure the political woes of the Balkans; indeed, it raises their urgency."
"Yugoslavia has disintegrated, but the disintegration is incomplete."
"It was in Yugoslavia that Vojislav Kostunica was elected president, but his mandate comes solely from support in Serbia."
"Montenegro, Serbia’s junior partner in the Yugoslav federation, mostly boycotted the election while Albanians in Kosovo ignored them."
"Yet it was Yugoslavia, whose foundations are unstable, that was recently admitted to the UN."
A host of problems remain unresolved: relations between Serbia and Montenegro and the status of Kosovo (not to mention Serbia’s northern province of Vojvodina).
Any resolution – any suggestion of change – will engender new conflicts because of conflicting claims of sovereignty.
"However tempting it may be to solve the puzzle by drawing new borders or establishing new entities, this conundrum cannot be resolved in terms of sovereignty."
That traditional solution would only perpetuate the problems of the Balkans.
A new approach is needed: the European Union should use the prospect of European integration as the way to promote regional integration.
The EU could act as a magnet to bring the region closer together by bringing the region as a whole closer to Europe.
"This idea has great appeal to people in the region, but only the EU can make it happen."
"After NATO intervention in Kosovo, European leaders made this approach the cornerstone of their vision for the Balkans."
"It was enshrined in the Stability Pact signed at the Sarajevo Summit of July, 1999."
But the Stability Pact is merely a shell – it needs to be filled with content.
The time to do so is at the Zagreb Conference on November 24 called by France as the current EU president.
The European Union should now propose a three-point plan for the Balkans:
$ a customs union with preferential access to EU markets within one year.
The existing EU-Turkey customs union should be used as a model.
Once all these countries reach agreement with the EU there would automatically be free trade throughout the Balkans.
This will take some time to implement.
"But from the start, the EU should give a signal by unilaterally opening its border to imports from the region."
This cannot endanger any EU interests as the countries at issue now have far less than 1% of the EU market.
$ a regional VAT to replace the lost customs revenues should be established within two years.
Differences in indirect taxes such as VAT pose another way in which borders become obstacles to trade.
They should be unified throughout the region.
Regional VAT rates might be increased slightly if expenditure restraint is not sufficient to offset the loss of tariff revenues due to the customs union.
"$ Temporary budgetary support on a declining scale for three years, subject to EU supervision over budgetary expenditures."
"Because it will take time to collect revenues from the regional VAT, the EU should provide financial help during the transition."
"The area covered by this plan would include Bulgaria, Croatia and Albania as well as Serbia, Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo."
Participation by Romania and Moldova is optional.
Bulgaria and Croatia could be persuaded to participate provided it would not interfere with their candidacy for EU membership.
"Depending on the country, there could be more or less budgetary support. (Bulgaria, for example, might not need compensation since to a great extent it has already eliminated tariffs)."
"In comparison to the cost of military intervention and peacekeeping, the financial costs here are ridiculously low."
"I estimate that Euro 750 million in the first year, Euro 500 million in the second year and Euro 250 million in the third year would do the trick. (If Romania and Moldova were included the figures would be slightly higher)."
These figures are well within range of pledges already made by the EU for the Stability Pact and they could be easily accommodated within the confines of the Berlin Accord on the EU budget for 2000-2005 if EU member states agree to a reallocation of unspent funds.
Budgetary support in the context of a Customs Union would be a more effective way to disburse EU funds than conventional methods.
This three-point program would lay the ground for economic resurgence.
It would remove two major sources of corruption and inefficiency: the customs service and the misuse of public funds in general.
It would create a trade area large enough to generate both local and foreign investment.
"The Deutsche Mark, already widely used in the region, now functions as the de facto common currency."
Any ban on its use should be lifted to make borders irrelevant for trade and investment.
"Improved economic prospects and the strengthening of institutions, in turn, would have a positive impact on the political climate throughout the Balkans."
Serbia has climbed part of the way out of the abyss.
Success in peacefully removing a tyrant has set in motion a process of national renewal.
But that process has a long way to go.
The opposition inherited a bankrupt country whose institutions are in ruins.
"The population, frustrated by ever deepening impoverishment and isolation, is beginning to question what happened over the past decade in Serbia."
People are asking about crimes committed by the Milosevic regime against Serbs.
"They must begin to come to terms with the crimes committed against others - in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo."
"Once that process is underway, many problems that now seem intractable will be resolved more easily."
Kostunica’s election as President of Yugoslavia amounts to an incomplete revolution: many of the old guard are still in place.
The momentum created by Milosevic’s overthrow needs to be maintained.
Milosevic was overthrown in the hope of ending Serbia’s isolation.
Europe must now fulfill its promise.
"If the French Presidency fails to seize the moment in Zagreb, an historic opportunity will be lost."
A Czech Moment
"PRAGUE – As I listened to what some Europeans were saying as my country prepared to take over the presidency of the European Union, I heard dim echoes of Neville Chamberlain’s infamous description of Czechoslovakia as “a faraway country of which we know little.”"
I suppose that Donald Rumsfeld’s misguided bid a few years ago to incite a divide between “new and old” Europe contributed to the re-emergence of that disdainful attitude.
"The reality is that there is no such thing as “old and new” Europe, and there never was."
The break with communism and reunification of Europe is now almost two decades old.
"We Czechs are 100% European, and were even when the Iron Curtain cut us off from democratic Europe."
"Indeed, our pro-EU sentiments may be all the stronger because our membership in the Union, like our freedom, is so comparatively new."
So no one in Europe needs to fear that the Czech Republic has some nostalgic or idiosyncratic agenda that it wants to impose on the Union.
"On the contrary, events have imposed an agenda on Europe that we cannot escape and for which solidarity – true union – will be needed."
"The primary, and most pressing, of the problems we face is the financial and economic crisis that is enveloping the EU."
"Unfortunately, conditions across the Union will likely worsen before they begin to improve."
"The type of social unrest recently witnessed in Greece may spread, because the downturn is likely to take a disproportionate toll on Europe’s young people, who are seeking jobs at a time when hard-pressed European businesses will be able to offer them very few."
"It will fall to the Union, once again, to help transform despair into hope."
"We Czechs know something about this, as the wrenching economic transition that we underwent in the 1990’s taught us much about how the right policies can break the grip of hopelessness."
"To contain today’s financial and economic crisis, Europe will also need to continue the cooperation that it has shown up to this point."
"The very existence of our Union, and particularly of the euro, has already helped to prevent the competitive devaluations and beggar-thy-neighbor policies that ravaged Europe during the 1930’s – the last time the continent faced so brutal an economic downturn."
But we cannot be complacent that the forces of national egoism will remain in check.
"For now, EU governments’ coordinated fiscal stimulus has deprived populists of their usual charge that the EU is indifferent to the fate of individuals."
Even more policy coordination will be needed both to confront the crisis and to re-establish EU norms once the storm clouds begin to dissipate.
"Although it is right that the Stability and Growth Pact has become more flexible in these extraordinary times, its rules did secure a successful first decade for the euro."
"These rules must eventually be restored intact if Europe is to return to the path of sustainable growth, and a consensus will need to be forged now to make that happen."
The second key challenge that we will face during our European presidency is that of Russia.
A new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) between the EU and the Russian Federation must be negotiated.
"Those negotiations should have begun seriously last year, but the war in Georgia intervened to put them on hold."
"Now those talks have resumed, but the background to the negotiations has changed dramatically."
Russia’s economy is now in far worse shape than that of EU members.
"The collapse of world oil and gas prices has wounded Russia’s budget, and lack of investment in the country’s energy sector over the years is now causing the declining production that economists have long predicted."
"Until now, Russia has cared less about a new PCA than the EU, because two-thirds of Russia’s exports to the Union comprise natural resources, which bring in cash even without the strong rules that a PCA provides."
"Given the stark changes in economic conditions, however, it is now in Russia’s national interest to reassure international markets that it is a reliable place to do business, for which a new PCA would serve as an ideal signal."
"Moreover, without a new PCA, individual European countries may feel it necessary to seek even more bilateral agreements with Russia. Indeed, many EU members have been in a race with each other to see who will be Russia’s closest friend in the Union."
"But the bilateral deals that have emerged from this race sometimes come at the expense of other Union members, and may unbalance relations within the Union as a whole. Only a rules-based EU framework can provide a firm foundation for both bilateral and Union-wide relations with Russia."
"Europe’s main strength in foreign policy is not its commitment to a rules-based multilateralism, important as that undoubtedly is, but its unity."
"When the Georgia crisis erupted, Europe united around a single position on Russia’s withdrawal."
"It is the Czech Republic’s task, and that of the Swedish EU presidency that will follow our own, to maintain this unity as the PCA negotiations move forward."
"During the 1990’s, the US and Europe erred in treating Russia with benign neglect. It would be a mistake for Russia to respond in kind today by seeking to prolong the PCA negotiations in the hope that a possibly more amenable EU president may one day offer softer terms."
"We, like all EU presidencies, will be representing the wider Union interests when we negotiate."
When Fewer Is Better
LONDON – Is a shrinking population always a bad thing?
"Judging by the lamentations of some economists and policymakers in the advanced economies, where people are living longer and birth rates have fallen below replacement levels, one certainly might think so."
"In fact, the benefits of demographic stability – or even slight decline – outweigh any adverse effects."
"To be sure, an aging population poses obvious challenges for pension systems."
"And, as economists like Paul Krugman have suggested, it could also mean that advanced economies face not only a slow recovery, but also the danger of “secular stagnation.”"
"With slower population growth, the need to invest in capital stock diminishes."
"Meanwhile, people planning for longer retirements may save more to ensure adequate pensions."
"If these savings exceed investment needs, they could lead to inadequate aggregate demand, depressing economic growth."
But the policy challenges associated with these demographic shifts are manageable.
"And, perhaps more important, the benefits of increased longevity and reduced fertility are considerable."
"Rising life expectancy is the welcome product of medical and economic progress, and additional increases are almost certain."
"Indeed, the average life expectancy for children born in prosperous countries could soon exceed 100."
That implies an ever-rising ratio of those over 65 to younger cohorts.
"But as long as average retirement ages rise to keep stable the proportions of life spent in work and in retirement, the fact that working and retirement years are growing at equal rates has no adverse economic effect."
"There is, moreover, strong evidence that rising longevity can mean more years of healthy active life, not unhealthy dependency."
"Only bad policies, such as the recent German commitment to reduce retirement ages, can turn longer lives into an economic problem."
"Declining fertility, including in some lower- and middle-income countries, such as Iran and Brazil, also reflects hugely positive social developments – particularly the empowerment of women."
"Wherever women have the right to an education and to choose how many children to have, fertility rates fall to or slightly below replacement levels."
"Falling birth rates challenge pension systems more than rising longevity, because they imply a rising old-age dependency ratio even if retirement ages increase in line with life expectancy."
"But as long as birth rates are only slightly below replacement level, pension systems’ sustainability can be ensured by means of affordable increases in contribution rates."
"And lower birth rates deliver the offsetting benefit of lower child dependency ratios, reducing education costs or enabling increased investment in education per child."
"Slower population growth might also reduce the increase in wealth-to-income ratios, and the resulting increase in inequality that Thomas Piketty recently highlighted."
"In many countries, the increase results primarily from the rise in real-estate prices relative to income, as more prosperous people devote a growing share of their income to purchasing property in desirable locations."
"Continued population growth would intensify competition for such “positional goods,” which are not easily supplied in greater volume."
"A stable population, or actual decline, would reduce their importance somewhat."
"It would also make it easier to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions at an acceptable cost, and to preserve and enhance local environmental quality, which people increasingly value as their incomes rise."
"For today’s advanced economies, a stable or slightly declining population would likely be optimal for human welfare."
"For the world as a whole, it is a desirable goal."
But it is also a distant goal.
"Indeed, population decline in the advanced countries remains far less of a problem than rapid population growth in many developing countries."
The United Nations’ medium fertility scenario projects that the world’s population will rise from seven billion today to ten billion by 2050.
"Nigeria’s population could rise from 123 million in 2000 to 440 million by 2050, while Yemen’s could grow from 18 million to 42 million."
High fertility rates in many countries are partly a consequence of low income.
But causation also runs the other way.
"High fertility rates stymie prospects for economic growth, because excessively rapid population growth makes it impossible to accumulate per capita stocks of physical and human capital at the pace required to drive rapid income gains."
"That said, efforts to control population growth through measures like China’s compulsory one-child policy are both morally abhorrent and unnecessary."
"As examples like Iran show, even low-income countries can achieve dramatic fertility reductions simply by providing choice and education."
But that does not change the fact that China’s rapid fertility decline played a major role in its extraordinary economic breakthrough.
Facile commentary often suggests the opposite: countries with high fertility rates supposedly enjoy the demographic dividend of a rapidly rising and youthful population.
"But, beyond some rate of population growth, jobs cannot be created fast enough to absorb the growing workforce."
Almost all countries with fertility rates well above replacement levels face economically and socially harmful youth-unemployment rates.
"Political instability in the Middle East has many causes, but among them is the lack of jobs for young people, especially young men."
"Yes, demographic slowdown may, as Krugman and others have argued, increase the risk of deficient demand and below-potential growth."
"But if the problem is inadequate demand, the danger can be averted."
"Governments and central banks can always create additional nominal demand if they are willing to use all of the policy tools available to them, such as debt- or money-financed public investment."
"And if there are underused resources, additional real growth will result."
"If aging populations lead to secular stagnation, the cause will be deficient policies."
"By contrast, the problems created by excessively rapid population growth are rooted in real and unavoidable constraints."
The manageable challenges created by rising life expectancy and lower birth rates should not be allowed to obscure the huge benefits of greater longevity and population stabilization.
And it certainly should not blind us to the adverse economic and social consequences of rapid population growth.
Rethinking the Monetization Taboo
"LONDON – Now that the pace of the US Federal Reserve’s “tapering” of its asset-purchase program has been debated to death, attention will increasingly turn to prospects for interest-rate increases."
But another question looms: How will central banks achieve a final “exit” from unconventional monetary policy and return balance sheets swollen by unconventional monetary policy to “normal” levels?
"To many, a larger issue needs to be addressed."
The Fed’s tapering merely slows the growth of its balance sheet.
The authorities would still have to sell $3 trillion of bonds to return to the pre-crisis status quo.
"The rarely admitted truth, however, is that there is no need for central banks’ balance sheets to shrink."
"They could stay permanently larger; and, for some countries, permanently bigger central-bank balance sheets will help reduce public-debt burdens."
"As a recent IMF paper by Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff illustrates, advanced economies face debt burdens that cannot be reduced simply through a mix of austerity, forbearance, and growth."
"But if a central bank owns the debt of its own government, no net public liability exists."
"The government owns the central bank, so the debt is to itself, and the interest expense comes back to the government as the central bank’s profit."
"If central bank holdings of government debt were converted into non-interest-bearing perpetual obligations, nothing substantive would change, but it would become obvious that some previously issued public debt did not need to be repaid."
This amounts to “helicopter money” after the fact.
"In 2003, then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke argued that Japan, facing deflation, should increase public expenditure or cut taxes, funding the operation by printing money rather than issuing bonds."
"This, he argued, was bound to increase national income, because the direct stimulative effect would not be offset by concern about future debt burdens."
His advice was not followed; large Japanese deficits were in fact bond-financed.
But the debts held by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) could still be written off.
"In Japan’s case, this would reduce government debt by an amount equal to more than 40% of GDP today, and around 60% if implemented after the bond purchases planned for 2014."
Objections focus on two risks: central-bank losses and excessive inflation.
But both of these outcomes can be avoided.
Central banks have bought government bonds with money on which they currently pay zero or very low interest rates.
"So, as interest rates rise, central banks might face costs exceeding their income."
"But central banks can choose to pay zero interest on a portion of the reserves that commercial banks hold with them, even when they increase the policy interest rate."
"And they can require commercial banks to hold zero-interest reserves at the central bank equal to a defined proportion of their loans, thus preventing inflationary growth of private credit and money."
Permanent monetization of government debts is undoubtedly technically possible.
Whether it is desirable depends on the outlook for inflation.
"Where inflation is returning to target levels, debt monetization could be unnecessarily and dangerously stimulative."
"Central-bank bond sales, while certainly not inevitable, may be appropriate."
"But if deflation is the danger, permanent monetization may be the best policy."
"I predict that Japan will, in effect, permanently monetize some government debt."
"After two decades of low growth and deflation, Japanese gross public debt is now above 240% of GDP (and above 140% of GDP on a net basis); and, with the fiscal deficit at 9.5% of GDP, the debt burden continues to increase."
"According to the IMF, to reduce its net public debt to 80% of GDP by 2030, Japan would have to turn today’s 8.6% primary budget deficit (the balance excluding interest payments) into a 6.7% primary surplus by 2020 and maintain such surpluses continuously until 2030."
"That will not happen, and any attempt to reach that target would drive Japan into a severe depression."
But the government does not need to repay the ¥140 trillion ($1.4 trillion) of its debt that the BoJ already owns.
The BoJ will continue to increase its balance sheet until it achieves its 2% inflation target.
"Thereafter, its balance sheet may stabilize in absolute yen terms and fall slowly as a percentage of GDP, but its absolute size will probably never decrease – a likelihood that should cause no concern."
It is precisely what happened to the Fed’s balance sheet after its wartime and postwar buying of US government bonds came to an end in 1951.
"Even as permanent monetization occurs, however, the truth may be obfuscated."
"If government bond repayments to the BoJ continued, but were always offset by new BoJ bond purchases, and if the BoJ kept the interest rate on reserves at zero, the net effect would be the same as a debt write-off, but the fiction of “normal” central-bank operations could be maintained."
Central banks can monetize debt while pretending not to.
"That pretense may reflect a useful taboo: if we overtly recognize that debt write-off/monetization is possible, politicians might want to do it all the time and in excess, not just in circumstances that make it appropriate."
"The historical experience of Weimar Germany, or that of Zimbabwe today, illustrates the danger."
"As a result, even when permanent monetization occurs – as it almost certainly will in Japan and possibly elsewhere – it may remain forever the policy that dare not speak its name. Such reticence may serve a useful purpose."
But it must not blind central banks and governments to the full range of policy tools available to address today’s severe debt overhangs.
The Great Credit Mistake
"LONDON – Before the financial crisis erupted in 2008, private credit in most developed economies grew faster than GDP. Then credit growth collapsed."
Whether that fall reflected low demand for credit or constrained supply may seem like a technical issue. But the answer holds important implications for policymaking and prospects for economic growth.
The prevailing view has usually stressed supply constraints and the policies needed to fix them.
"An impaired banking system, it is argued, starves businesses, particularly small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), of the funds they need to expand."
"In September 2008, US President George W. Bush wanted to “free up banks to resume the flow of credit to American families and businesses.”"
The stress tests and recapitalizations of US banks in 2009 were subsequently hailed as crucial to the recovery of both the banking system and the economy.
"By contrast, the European Central Bank’s inadequately tough stress tests in 2010 were widely panned for leaving eurozone banks too weak to provide adequate credit."
"In the United Kingdom, banks have been criticized for not lending the reserves created by quantitative easing to the real economy, leading the Bank of England to introduce its “funding for lending” scheme in 2012."
"In the eurozone, it is hoped that this year’s asset quality review (AQR) and stress tests will finally dispel concerns about bank solvency and free up credit supply."
A “credit crunch” – particularly in trade finance – was certainly a key reason why the financial crisis generated a real economy recession.
"Taxpayer-funded bank rescues, higher bank capital requirements, and ultra-easy monetary policy have all been vital to overcome credit supply constraints. But there is strong evidence that once the immediate crisis was over, lack of demand for credit played a far larger role than restricted supply in impeding economic growth."
"That argument is persuasively made by Atif Mian and Amir Sufi in House of Debt, an important new book that analyzes US data on a county-by-county basis."
"Mian and Sufi show that the recession was caused by a collapse of household consumption, and that consumption fell most in those counties where pre-crisis borrowing and post-crisis real-estate prices left households facing the largest relative losses in net wealth."
"It was in those US counties, too, that local businesses cut employment most aggressively."
"For SMEs, a shortage of customers, not a shortage of credit, constrained borrowing, employment, and output."
And the customers were absent because the pre-crisis credit boom had left them over-leveraged.
"In the UK, many business surveys from 2009-2012 told the same story."
Poor customer demand was ranked well ahead of credit availability as a constraint on growth.
Economic growth can indeed continue to be severely depressed by a debt overhang even when credit supply is unrestricted and cheap.
Many Japanese companies were left overleveraged by the boom and bust in credit and real estate in the 1980s and early 1990s.
"By the late 1990s, the Japanese banking system was offering companies loans at near-zero interest rates. But, rather than borrow to invest, firms cut investment to pay down debt, driving two decades of stagnation and deflation."
"Since 2011, the ECB’s analysis of weak eurozone growth has stressed the negative impact of an impaired and fragmented financial system, with high sovereign-bond yields and funding costs for banks resulting in prohibitive lending terms in the peripheral countries."
Major progress in fixing these problems has already been achieved.
"The ECB’s latest Monthly Bulletin documents this, citing multiple indicators of improved credit availability and pricing."
"Nonetheless, the rate of decline in private-sector loans has accelerated over the last year – from -0.6% to -2% – and low demand is acknowledged to be the main driver of depressed credit growth."
Simultaneous private deleveraging and fiscal consolidation are restricting eurozone growth far more than remaining restrictions on credit supply.
"Despite the ECB’s own evidence, however, the policy focus remains on fixing the credit-supply problem, through the AQR and stress tests, and through the ECB’s own version of a funding for lending scheme, announced on June 5. That reflects a recurring tendency in official policy debates, particularly in the eurozone, to concentrate on fixable problems to the exclusion of more difficult issues."
Fixing impaired banking systems after a crisis is both essential and achievable.
"Moreover, even when public rescue costs are inevitable, they are typically small change compared to the economic harm wrought by the financial crisis and post-crisis recession."
"By contrast, a large debt overhang may be intractable unless policy orthodoxies are challenged."
Japan offset private deleveraging in the 1990s by running massive public deficits.
"The US has pulled out of recession faster than the eurozone, not only – or even primarily – because it fixed its banking system faster, but because it pursued more stimulative fiscal policies."
"But fiscal stimulus is constrained within the eurozone, where member countries no longer issue their own currency and “sovereign” debt therefore carries a default risk."
Aggressive monetary expansion through quantitative easing is also far more complicated and politically contentious in a currency area with no federal debt for the central bank to buy.
"To survive and thrive, the eurozone will need to become more centralized, with some common fiscal revenues, expenditures, and debts."
"Of course, this scenario implies immensely difficult political choices. But the starting point for debate must be realism about the nature and severity of the problems facing the eurozone."
"If eurozone policy assumes that fixing the banks will fix the economy, the next ten years in Europe could look like the 1990s in Japan."
Adapting to Climate Change
COPENHAGEN – Striking the right balance between preventing global warming and adapting to its effects is one of the most important – and most vexing – policy questions of our age.
It is also often ignored.
"According to the conventional wisdom of many environmental campaigners, we should first do everything we can to mitigate global warming, and only then focus on adaptation strategies."
This seems wrong – even immoral – if we could do more for people and the planet through adaptation.
"Moreover, it is inconsistent with the inescapable fact that, whatever we do, we cannot prevent all of global warming’s effects."
"If we are ill-prepared, global warming will cause more deaths and devastation, especially in poor countries and fragile societies."
Adaptation would also mean saving many lives from catastrophes not related to global warming.
"If we prepare societies for more ferocious hurricanes in the future, for example, we are also helping them to cope better with today’s extreme weather."
"There has been a huge amount of research into the ways that humans cause climate change, and how we can reduce it."
Much less work has been devoted to adaptation.
It is important to acknowledge that some adaptation strategies will lead to more greenhouse-gas emissions.
"Responding to water scarcity by re-using and treating wastewater, or through deep-well pumping and desalination, will increase fossil-fuel use."
Using more air-conditioning to cool our houses in summer will do the same – although this is vital if we want to save lives.
"Adaptation could allow for higher carbon emissions in another way: reducing the damage and harm that we experience from global warming, giving us more time to implement alternatives to reliance on fossil fuels."
Should any of this stop us from using adaptation strategies?
"To arrive at an informed answer, we need to work out how the planet will look in 2100 if we invest different amounts in adaptation and carbon cuts."
We need to take into account the increase in emissions that adaptation will cause.
The most critical issue isn’t any rise or fall in emissions.
It is how much climate damage we can avoid.
How much of the planet can we help by dealing with rising sea levels?
"How many lives can we spare from heat, starvation, or malaria?"
These are the real reasons we care about global warming.
"Reaching a proper answer to these questions requires extensive economic modeling, with different variables calculated and regional differences analyzed."
"New research by three Italian economists, Francesco Bosello, Carlo Carraro, and Enrica De Cian does this, and, ultimately, provides a powerful economic case for a much greater focus on adaptation."
They first look at the different ways that climate change will affect us at mid-century.
"This work is based on standard scenarios, and carries the typical caveats of predictions far into the future."
"Nevertheless, they find that many of our biggest concerns will turn out to be trivial, or even beneficial."
"Sea-level rises will be a very minor concern for every country, with the financial impact adding up to less than 0.1% of GDP."
Health problems will be negligible for all but a few nations.
And global warming’s impact would reduce energy consumption for almost all nations.
"The important effects are on agriculture and tourism, where nations will lose, on average, about 0.5% of GDP from each sector."
But much of this damage will be avoided by people choosing for themselves to adapt to a change in their environment.
Farmers will choose plants that thrive in heat.
New houses will be designed to deal with warmer temperatures.
"Simple economic models, often quoted in the media, show that unconstrained global warming would cost a substantial 2% of GDP in the rich world by the end of the century. But this fails to acknowledge that people will change their behavior when the environment changes."
"Taking adaptation into account, rich countries will adapt to the negative consequences of global warming and exploit the positive changes, creating a total"
"Poor countries will be hit harder, however."
Adaptation will reduce the climate change-related losses from 5% of GDP to slightly less than 3% – but this is still a significant impact.
"The real challenge of global warming, therefore, lies in tackling its impact on the Third World."
"Here, more needs to be done, above and beyond the adaptation that will happen naturally."
"Importantly, the new research shows that adaptation would achieve a lot more than cuts in carbon emissions."
"Reducing emissions to a level that does not extinguish economic growth could avert $3 trillion worth of damage, whereas adaptation could prevent around $8 trillion worth of damage."
"For every dollar spent on adaptation, we would achieve about $1.70 worth of positive changes for the planet."
The economic case for focusing more on adaptation is clear.
The crucial next step is to ensure that economic arguments become a stronger part of our political debate about how to address global warming.
Adapt or Die
"MILAN – In rapidly growing emerging markets, a combination of internal economic forces, supportive policies, and the shifting nature of the global economy drive high-speed and far-reaching change."
"The transformation of economic structures occurs so quickly that it is virtually impossible not to notice –&nbsp;though the complexity of the change is, at times, bewildering."
"In this fluid environment, mistakes are frequently made. Arguably the most damaging is to stick to a successful growth strategy (a combination of comparative advantage and supportive policies) for too long."
"In the economy’s tradable sector, comparative advantage always shifts, causing structural change and creative destruction."
"Countries undergoing a “middle-income transition” out of poor-country status frequently try to resist these changes, but doing so causes growth to slow, if not stop altogether."
"While the private sector (domestic and external) drives these shifts, government policies and public-sector investment patterns play an essential supporting and complementary role."
"These need to adapt, too."
"The policy framework that has proven to serve the major emerging economies best is one that focuses not only on macro and monetary stability, but also on adaptation, guided by a forward-looking (though inherently imperfect) assessment of coming micro and macro structural shifts and the measures needed to support them."
What of the large advanced countries?
"For historical reasons, the policy mindset is less flexible and adaptive."
"Structural change is viewed largely as the province of the private sector, and hence not as a key part of long-term policy thinking."
"In the postwar period, until recently, advanced economies dominated the global economy."
"Emerging economies’ impact on them was relatively small, and they have yet to respond adequately to the rapid structural changes in the global economy."
"A small example: as recently as July 8, after the latest disappointing employment report in the United States, President Barack Obama expressed the widely held view that an agreement on the debt ceiling and deficit reduction would remove the uncertainty that is holding back business investment, growth, and employment."
"In other words, America’s fiscal problems explain its extremely weak economic recovery."
"Once a fiscal deal is done, government can step aside and let the private sector drive the structural changes that are needed to restore a pattern of inclusive growth."
"To be fair, there have been exceptions to this stance."
"In the US, a postwar alliance of government, business, and academia created the human capital and technology base of a dynamic economy, reinforced by the post-Sputnik commitment to scientific and technological excellence and innovation."
"In Germany, the post-2000 reforms that reset the economy’s productivity, flexibility, and competitiveness have proved crucial to the country’s current economic strength and resilience."
"Despite these examples, economic and financial commentators appear increasingly puzzled about the weak US recovery, with its modest GDP growth and meager employment gains."
Growth estimates since the 2008 crisis have been revised downward several times.
The political narrative runs in parallel.
A recent (admittedly partisan) study by the US Congress’s Joint Economic Committee documents the relative weakness of the current recovery.
"Indeed, the differences between the current situation and other postwar US recoveries are so large that the term “recovery” in today’s context is dubious."
"But US leaders nonetheless accept the cyclical view of the economy, see a weak recovery, and blame it on post-crisis policy failures."
"But, while that might play well politically, the sensible conclusion is that this is not just a cyclical recovery, but rather the beginning of a delayed process of structural adaptation to a rapidly shifting global economy, to emerging economies’ growth and shifting comparative advantage, and to powerful technological forces."
"While these changes are difficult to think about with any degree of precision, that doesn’t make them unimportant."
"Of course, no one would deny that there are cyclical elements in the downturn of 2008."
"But they were accompanied by structural imbalances that had been building over at least 15 years, and that are at the heart of the US economy’s inability to bounce back in a normal cyclical way."
"Skeptics might well question why, if these alleged structural imbalances are now impeding GDP and employment growth, they did not appear before the crisis."
"The answer is that they did, but not in growth and employment figures."
"Other signals were missed, ignored, or deemed unimportant."
"A short list of these signals would include excess consumption (now gone) and deficient savings, based on an asset bubble and high debt; a persistent and growing current-account deficit (signaling that domestic consumption and investment exceeded income and output); and negligible net employment growth (over two decades) in the economy’s tradable sector."
"With domestic aggregate demand in short supply, the only functioning growth engine, external trade in goods and services, is not an employment engine."
"Missing all of these signals produced the pre-crisis illusion of sustainable growth and employment, and helps explain why the crisis, rather than its causes, is viewed as the culprit."
"The crisis, however, merely exposed the underlying imbalances and unwound some of them."
The “grand bargain” that PIMCO CEO Mohamed El-Erian recently alluded to in describing the appropriate response to the current situation in the US needs to include a fiscal stabilization plan.
But it also must include a shift to a policy framework that accurately reflects the non-cyclical nature of the longer-term structural adaptations that will be required to restore growth and employment.
A Daughter of Dictatorship and Democracy
"SEOUL – It is something of a cliché question in South Korea nowadays: Who would be the country’s next president if the election were held tomorrow, rather than in December 2012?"
Numerous opinion polls show Park Geun-hye of the ruling Grand National Party (GNP) to be the leading candidate.
"If elected, she would be South Korea’s first woman president, and, for her rivals, her dominant position in the race is an uncomfortable but unassailable fact."
South Korean voters of all ages and regions have welcomed Park as a candidate for their country’s leadership.
"Her political style is both refreshing and relevant, because she comes across as sincere and forthright at a time when the public is hungry for moral leadership. And she has an astonishing talent for simplifying complicated issues accurately, which she likely learned – along with how to interpret and manipulate the political connotations of every issue – from her father, former President Park Chung-hee."
"Acclaimed as a national hero among radical right-wingers, the iron-fisted Park Chung-hee ruled South Korea from 1963 to 1979, in the wake of the 1961 military coup, only to be assassinated by his intelligence chief."
"His daughter is proud of his legacy, which marked the beginning of South Korea’s economic boom."
"Indeed, as a pillar of export-oriented modernity, Park Chung-hee was once lionized as the archetype of a modernizing political leadership in military-authoritarian states."
"At home, he still ranks first in popularity among the country’s heads of state, kindling nostalgia like a popular old record – a corollary to people’s frustration and anger at the current government of President Lee Myung-bak."
"Park, who lost her first bid for the GNP’s nomination to Lee in 2007, needs to ensure that no rupture with her erstwhile rival knocks her off the path to victory in 2012."
"An astute politician, Park did not hesitate to campaign wholeheartedly for Lee the last time around – a move that, as part of long-term political strategy, made perfect sense."
"To many South Koreans, the election is now Park’s to lose."
No candidate on the horizon seems able to stop her.
"If she wins, it will be the result of her seriousness and tenacity, not her political heritage."
"No one in South Korea’s conservative movement doubts that Park is one of them. And, as an icon of the right, she is well aware that she cannot afford to betray her status."
"Despite her charisma, Park is neither a Sarah Palin nor an Eva Peron."
"Indeed, she looks more like a Korean Margaret Thatcher – a lady not for turning, in Thatcher’s famous phrase, and with clearly thought-through political principles animating her actions."
"In any case, she seems destined to establish a new South Korea focusing on her landmark pledge ‘jul pu se,’ literally meaning ‘reduce-loosen-strengthen tax-cuts,’ deregulation, and law and order, not just to add another chapter to her father’s old book."
Her administration would mark a fresh departure from the country’s troubled recent past.
"Left-leaning pundits claim that the dictator’s daughter has the same autocratic vision as her father, though Park invariably prefers incremental change to radical measures, and cut her political teeth in the tough-minded politics of the GNP."
"Others take a flagrantly sexist stance, arguing that a woman president would be a non-starter as long as the North Korean regime continues to threaten national security."
"Although these criticisms don’t seem to bother the electorate very much, Park’s path to victory may yet prove narrower than her supporters expect."
"She has been called the “Queen of Elections,” in particular since she won a campaign in 2006 after being slashed with a box cutter by a deranged man. But she must convincingly outline practical strategies to resolve South Korea’s most serious problems, including high unemployment, worsening educational performance, and North Korea’s nuclear weapons program."
"Ms. Park once pledged to provide loans for working-class families from elementary school to college years, while contending that local universities should be empowered to have more autonomy."
She favors engagement policy and the six-party talks so as to resolve the nuclear troubles.
"Come presidential election-day in 2012, South Korean voters will pick the candidate who embodies pragmatism and centrism over a partisan or ideologue."
"Park’s success will depend, in the end, on the effectiveness of her campaign in further defining her character along those lines."
"Unlike former Peruvian dictator Alberto Fujimori’s daughter, who lost her presidential bid in Peru last month, Park is likely to defy her family’s tragic history."
"If she does, she will be Asia’s most powerful woman, perhaps the most powerful in the world, at the end of next year."
A Day for Planetary Justice
"PRINCETON – What we are doing to our planet, to our children and grandchildren, and to the poor, by our heedless production of greenhouse gases, is one of the great moral wrongs of our age."
"On October 24, you can stand up against this injustice."
October 24 is 350 Day.
"The name comes from the number of parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that, according to Jim Hansen, perhaps the world’s leading climate scientist, we should not exceed if we are to avoid potentially catastrophic climate change."
"It is a measure of the seriousness of our problem that CO2 is already at 386 ppm, and is rising by two ppm each year."
The need to cut greenhouse gases has become increasingly clear as predictions of global warming – denounced as “alarmist” when they were first made just a few years ago – have repeatedly turned out to have been too conservative.
"We are approaching a point of no return, at which feedback loops will kick in and continue to warm the planet, no matter what we do."
The melting of arctic ice is one example.
"Four hundred years ago, explorers sought the legendary “Northeast Passage” across the north of Europe and Russia to China."
"They found the arctic ice impenetrable, and soon gave up their quest."
"This year, commercial vessels successfully navigated the Northeast Passage."
That is one of many recent dramatic signs that our climate is changing and that our planet is warmer than it has been for a very long time.
But ice-free arctic waters are more than a symptom of global warming.
They are themselves a cause of further warming: ice and snow reflect the sun’s rays.
"An ice-free surface absorbs more warmth from the sun than one covered in snow or ice. In other words, our greenhouse gas emissions have, by causing enough warming to melt the arctic ice, created a feedback loop that will generate more warming, and melt more ice, even if we were to stop emitting all greenhouse gases tomorrow."
Other feedback loops pose a similar danger.
"In Siberia, vast quantities of methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas, are locked up in what used to be called “permafrost” – regions in which it was assumed that the ground was permanently frozen."
"But areas that used to be frozen are now thawing, releasing methane and thus contributing to further warming – and to further thawing, which releases more methane."
Developing nations are grasping just how outrageous the current distribution of greenhouse-gas emissions really is.
"At the United Nations Summit on Climate Change in September, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda pointed out that, while developed nations outside Africa are almost entirely responsible for the problem, its greatest impact will probably be on Africa, which has few resources to cope with the challenge."
"Kagame then suggested giving every country an annual per capita quota for CO2 emissions, and allowing developing countries that are below the quota to trade their excess quota with countries that are above theirs."
"The money that developing countries would receive for this would not be aid, but rather a recognition that the rich nations must pay for something that in the past they simply appropriated: far more than their fair share of our atmosphere’s capacity to absorb our waste gases."
"Sri Lanka took a similar stance, using studies from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to calculate that in 2008, environmentally permissible carbon emissions totaled no more than 2,172 kilograms per person."
"In fact, the world’s per capita emissions were 4,700 kilograms, or more than double the permissible limit."
"But, while emissions in the rich nations were far above the permissible limit, Sri Lankan emissions were, at 660 kilograms, well below it."
"As Sri Lanka’s government pointed out, “That means low-emitting countries like us could not emit more because our space has already been exploited by developed or global heavy polluting countries without our consent.”"
"This situation is an injustice of vast proportions, reminiscent of – and arguably much worse than – the now-repudiated colonialism of the Western powers in the nineteenth century."
The task of remedying it must begin at the meeting on climate change that will be held in Copenhagen in December.
"Many political leaders have expressed support for strong action on climate change, but what most of them regard as “strong action” will not be enough to get us back below 350 ppm."
"In some countries, including the United States, there are major political obstacles to taking even modest steps."
"On October 24, people in nearly every country will be taking action to raise awareness of the need for an international treaty to bring our atmosphere back to 350 ppm of CO2."
"There will be climbers hanging banners high in the Himalayas, where the glaciers are melting, and scuba divers at Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, which is threatened by climate change."
"Churches will ring bells 350 times, 350 cyclists will circle towns, and, in many places, 350 trees will be planted."
At
Crashing the SDR
"SANTA BARBARA – The Chinese government’s campaign to have its currency, the renminbi, included in the International Monetary Fund’s reserve asset appears to be on the brink of success."
"Last week, IMF staff formally recommended adding the renminbi to the basket of currencies that determines the value of its so-called Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)."
"The addition of the renminbi to the basket, which currently includes the US dollar, the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen, would provide China with a boost to its prestige."
"More important, it would advance the government’s efforts to internationalize the renminbi."
But it would also be a mistake.
"The decision to recommend the renminbi’s inclusion, far from having been made on sound economic grounds, can only be understood as political."
"As such, the long-term consequences are likely to be regrettable."
"On a purely technical basis, the renminbi’s qualifications for inclusion in the SDR basket are questionable."
"Traditionally, the IMF has insisted on two criteria: a currency’s issuing country must be among the world’s leading exporters, and the currency must be “freely usable” – widely used and traded."
"As the world’s largest exporter, China clearly meets the first condition."
"The second, however, is probably still beyond its reach."
The renminbi is by no means in the same league as the SDR basket’s four incumbent currencies.
"In 2014, China’s currency ranked seventh in global central-bank reserves, eighth in international bond issuance, and 11th in global currency trading."
"Moreover, the renminbi remains non-convertible for most capital transactions, China’s financial markets are primitive, and trading margins for the exchange rate are still set daily by the monetary authorities."
"Indeed, as recently as August, the IMF was skeptical about adding the renminbi to the SDR basket, saying that “significant work” was still needed, and suggesting that a decision should be put off until 2016 in order to ensure a “smooth” transition."
So why did the IMF flip?
The answer is obvious: China mounted a full-court press to change minds.
"In August, the currency’s exchange-rate regime was loosened slightly."
"Renminbi-denominated government bonds were issued in London, and plans were laid to create new trading platforms for the currency in several European financial centers."
And Chinese policymakers made it abundantly clear how unhappy they would be with a negative decision.
Their pressure paid off.
"One by one, Western governments fell in line behind the renminbi, despite its practical limitations."
"The Fund got the message, and now the fix is in."
"The recommendation to enlarge the SDR basket has been warmly backed by Christine Lagarde, the IMF’s managing director, and a final decision by the Fund’s executive board is expected at the end of the month."
Many would argue that this is a positive development.
"Certainly, it mollifies China’s leaders, offering them a stronger incentive to continue to work within the existing international monetary regime."
"Recent Chinese initiatives, especially the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, have given rise to fears that the country intends to build a new set of international institutions to compete with Western-dominated organizations like the IMF."
The decision to add the renminbi to the SDR basket may have put that danger into remission.
"On the other hand, the move sets a worrying precedent, injecting politics into a policy area that had been governed by objective economic considerations."
"Conceivably, over the longer term, China’s successful campaign could now open the door to lobbying by other governments to include their currencies as well."
Why not add the Swiss franc or the Canadian dollar?
"Or, for that matter, why not include the Russian ruble or Indian rupee?"
What was once the dignified preserve of obviously elite currencies could become the site of messy political battles for elevated status.
"Of course, it can be argued that China’s recent economic trajectory means that it is only a matter of time before the renminbi does become a match for the SDR’s incumbents."
"After all, international use of the currency has been growing exponentially."
But that optimistic assessment overestimates the renminbi’s prospects and illustrates the danger of linear extrapolation of the past into the future.
"Likewise, use of the renminbi for the purpose of invoicing and settling trade with China is bound to continue growing."
"But in terms of the all-important roles of a currency as an investment vehicle or reserve asset, the outlook for the renminbi is much less promising, owing to China’s still-tight capital controls and low level of financial development."
Nor is inclusion of the renminbi in the SDR basket likely to provide as big a boost to the currency’s internationalization as many believe.
"Some central banks may decide to follow suit, adding renminbi-denominated assets to their reserves to match the composition of the basket."
"But the increase will be marginal at best – some $40 billion in the next few years, according to the IMF’s calculations."
"With global reserves now totaling more than $10 trillion, that is a mere drop in the proverbial bucket."
The political reasons for including the renminbi in the SDR are all too clear.
"Unfortunately, the risks of doing so are no less obvious."
अंतर्राष्ट्रीय कर सहयोग की विफलता
"न्यूयॉर्क – दुनिया की अधिकतर सरकारें कराधान के मामलों में सहयोग करने में रुचि रखती हैं क्योंकि वे विकास के वित्तपोषण के लिए अधिक कर राजस्व जुटाने और ऐसी व्यापक कर-वंचन योजनाओं पर अंकुश लगाने के लिए उत्सुक हैं जिनका पिछले वर्ष तथाकथित लक्ज़मबर्ग लीक कांड में खुलासा हुआ था। फिर भी पिछले महीने अदीस अबाबा में आयोजित विकास के लिए वित्तपोषण पर तीसरे अंतर्राष्ट्रीय सम्मेलन में, अंतर्राष्ट्रीय कर सहयोग को मजबूत करने की गति में अचानक अवरोध आ गया था।"
"विकसित देशों ने इस सम्मेलन में संयुक्त राष्ट्र की विशेषज्ञों की मौजूदा समिति के स्थान पर संयुक्त राष्ट्र के भीतर एक अंतर-सरकारी कर निकाय की स्थापना करने के एक प्रस्ताव को रोक दिया। ये देश इस बात पर जोर देते हैं कि कर सहयोग के मामले पर अनन्य रूप से ओईसीडी के नेतृत्व में विचार किया जाना चाहिए, जो एक ऐसा निकाय है जिसका नियंत्रण उनके हाथ में है।"
"दुनिया के बाकी देशों को यह आशा करनी चाहिए कि 13 साल पहले मॉन्टेरी, मेक्सिको में विकास के लिए वित्तपोषण पर पहले अंतर्राष्ट्रीय सम्मेलन में जिस अंतर्राष्ट्रीय कर सहयोग की शुरूआत हुई थी, इससे उसकी प्रगति का अंत नहीं होगा बल्कि इसमें एक ठहराव आएगा। दो वर्ष बाद, 2004 में, संयुक्त राष्ट्र आर्थिक और सामाजिक परिषद (ECOSOC) ने कर विशेषज्ञों के अपने ""तदर्थ समूह"" को एक नियमित समिति के रूप में उन्नत किया। इसका अर्थ यह था कि विशेषज्ञ नियमित रूप से मिलेंगे और वे एक विस्तारित अधिदेश के अंतर्गत कार्य करेंगे जिसका कार्यक्षेत्र मॉडल दोहरे-कराधान की संधि को अद्यतन करने मात्र से बहुत अधिक बढ़ गया था।"
"चार वर्ष बाद, दोहा, कतर में विकास के लिए वित्तपोषण पर दूसरे सम्मेलन में, नीति निर्माताओं ने यह स्वीकार किया कि कर संबंधी मामलों में अभी और अधिक किया जाना जरूरी है, और उन्होंने ECOSOC से अनुरोध किया कि वह संस्थागत व्यवस्थाओं को मजबूत करने पर विचार करे। और उसके बाद, अदीस अबाबा सम्मेलन के वर्ष में, संयुक्त राष्ट्र के महासचिव ने ""संयुक्त राष्ट्र के तत्वावधान में, कर सहयोग पर एक अंतर-सरकारी समिति"" की आवश्यकता का समर्थन किया।"
"उनके समर्थन, गैर-सरकारी संगठनों और अंतर्राष्ट्रीय कॉर्पोरेट कराधान के सुधार के लिए स्वतंत्र आयोग का भारी समर्थन मिलने से 77 देशों के समूह और चीन के इर्द-गिर्द संगठित विकासशील देशों की इस मांग को और अधिक बल मिला कि वैश्विक कर मानदंड स्थापित करने के मामले में उन्हें भी अपनी राय प्रकट करने का समान अधिकार मिलना चाहिए। अदीस अबाबा में वार्ता के अंतिम क्षणों तक वे एक ऐसे अंतर-सरकारी निकाय की मांग पर डटे रहे जिसके पास अंतर्राष्ट्रीय कर सहयोग के लिए सुसंगत वैश्विक ढांचा बनाने के लिए अधिदेश और संसाधन हों।"
"लेकिन इसका कोई लाभ नहीं हुआ: संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिका और यूनाइटेड किंगडम - जो ""लक्स लीक"" में फंसे कई बहुराष्ट्रीय निगमों का मूल-स्थान है - के नेतृत्व में विकसित देश वैश्विक शासन में इस बहुप्रतीक्षित कदम को रोकने में सफल रहे। अंत में, अदीस अबाबा की कार्रवाई के एजेंडा के अनुसार विशेषज्ञों की वर्तमान समिति अपने 2004 के अधिदेश के अनुसार कार्य करती रहेगी, प्रति वर्ष तीन अतिरिक्त बैठक दिवस होंगे, ये सभी स्वैच्छिक योगदान के माध्यम से वित्तपोषित होंगे। यह अत्यधिक निराशाजनक परिणाम है।"
"विकसित देशों के पास तर्क तो है - लेकिन कोई ठोस तर्क नहीं है। ओईसीडी, जिसके सदस्य मुख्य रूप से दुनिया के 34 सबसे अमीर देश हैं, के पास निश्चित रूप से कराधान पर अंतर्राष्ट्रीय मानक स्थापित करने की क्षमता है। फिर भी कर मानदंडों के मामले में कुछ देशों के एक चयनित समूह का वर्चस्व होने का मतलब यह रहा है कि वास्तव में, कराधान के लिए वैश्विक शासन का ढाँचा भूमंडलीकरण के साथ तालमेल नहीं रख पाया है।"
2002 में हुई मॉन्टेरी आम सहमति में अंतर्राष्ट्रीय आर्थिक निर्णय लेने और मानदंड स्थापित करने में विकासशील देशों की राय सुने जाने और उनकी भागीदारी को बढ़ाने की मांग को शामिल किया गया था। हालांकि ओईसीडी मानदंडों को स्थापित करने के लिए अपने विचार-विमर्शों में भाग लेने के लिए कुछ विकासशील देशों को आमंत्रित तो करता है लेकिन यह उन्हें निर्णय लेने की कोई शक्ति प्रदान नहीं करता है। इस प्रकार ओईसीडी वैश्विक स्तर पर प्रतिनिधित्व करनेवाले एक अंतर-सरकारी मंच के लिए किराए की एक कमजोर कोख के रूप में है।
"इस तरह के निकाय का संचालन संयुक्त राष्ट्र के तत्वावधान में किया जाना चाहिए जिसके पास वैश्वीकरण की चुनौतियों के लिए सुसंगत वैश्विक मानकों के साथ प्रभावी ढंग से प्रतिक्रिया करने के लिए आवश्यक संस्थागत औचित्य उपलब्ध हो, ताकि अपमानजनक कर प्रथाओं का विरोध किया जा सके और विश्व भर में कंपनियों के लाभों पर उचित कराधान सुनिश्चित किया जा सके।"
"अदीस अबाबा में हुई निराशा के बावजूद, अंतर्राष्ट्रीय कर प्रणाली में सुधार के लिए मांग को दबा पाने की संभावना नहीं है। इसके बजाय, यह मांग चहुँ ओर अधिक जोर से बढ़ेगी, क्योंकि अंतर्राष्ट्रीय सहयोग के मामले में किसी प्रकार के समझौते के बारे में विकसित देशों के प्रतिकूल प्रतिरोध का परिणाम ऐसे एकतरफा कर उपायों की सुनामी के रूप में होगा जो ओईसीडी के नियंत्रण से बाहर होंगे।"
The Mouse Click that Roared
"CAMBRIDGE – Until recently, cyber security has primarily interested computer geeks and cloak-and-dagger types."
"The Internet’s creators, part of a small, enclosed community, were very comfortable with an open system in which security was not a primary concern."
"But, with some three billion or so users on the Web nowadays, that very openness has become a serious vulnerability; indeed, it is endangering the vast economic opportunities that the Internet has opened for the world."
"A “cyber attack” can take any number of forms, including simple probes, defacement of Web sites, denial-of-service attacks, espionage, and destruction of data."
"And the term “cyber war,” though best defined as any hostile action in cyberspace that amplifies or is equivalent to major physical violence, remains equally protean, reflecting definitions of “war” that range from armed conflict to any concerted effort to solve a problem (for example, “war on poverty”)."
"Cyber war and cyber espionage are largely associated with states, while cyber crime and cyber terrorism are mostly associated with non-state actors."
"The highest costs currently stem from espionage and crime; but, over the next decade or so, cyber war and cyber terrorism may become greater threats than they are today."
"Moreover, as alliances and tactics evolve, the categories may increasingly overlap."
"Terrorists might buy malware from criminals, and governments might find it useful to hide behind both."
"Some people argue that deterrence does not work in cyberspace, owing to the difficulties of attribution."
"But that is facile: inadequate attribution affects inter-state deterrence as well, yet it still operates."
"Even when the source of an attack can be successfully disguised under a “false flag,” governments may find themselves sufficiently enmeshed in symmetrically interdependent relationships such that a major attack would be counterproductive."
"China, for example, would lose from an attack that severely damaged the American economy, and vice versa."
An unknown attacker may also be deterred by cyber-security measures.
"If firewalls are strong, or redundancy and resilience allow quick recovery, or the prospect of a self-enforcing response (“an electric fence”) seems possible, an attack becomes less attractive."
"While accurate attribution of the ultimate source of a cyber attack is sometimes difficult, the determination does not have to be airtight."
"To the extent that false flags are imperfect and rumors of the source of an attack are widely deemed credible (though not legally probative), reputational damage to an attacker’s soft power may contribute to deterrence."
"Finally, a reputation for offensive capability and a declared policy that keeps open the means of retaliation can help to reinforce deterrence."
"Of course, non-state actors are harder to deter, so improved defenses such as pre-emption and human intelligence become important in such cases."
"But, among states, even nuclear deterrence was more complex than it first looked, and that is doubly true of deterrence in the cyber domain."
"Given its global nature, the Internet requires a degree of international cooperation to be able to function."
Some people call for the cyber equivalent of formal arms-control treaties.
But differences in cultural norms and the difficulty of verification would make such treaties hard to negotiate or implement.
"At the same time, it is important to pursue international efforts to develop rules of the road that can limit conflict."
The most promising areas for international cooperation today most likely concern problems posed for states by third parties such as criminals and terrorists.
"Russia and China have sought to establish a treaty establishing broad international oversight of the Internet and “information security,” which would prohibit deception and embedding malicious code or circuitry that could be activated in the event of war."
But the US has argued that arms-control measures banning offensive capabilities could weaken defenses against attacks and would be impossible to verify or enforce.
"Likewise, in terms of political values, the US has resisted agreements that could legitimize authoritarian governments’ censorship of the Internet – for example, by the “great firewall of China.”"
"Moreover, cultural differences impede any broad agreements on regulating online content."
"Nonetheless, it may be possible to identify behaviors like cyber crime that are illegal in many domestic jurisdictions."
"Trying to limit all intrusions would be impossible, but one could start with cyber crime and cyber terrorism involving non-state parties."
"Here, major states would have an interest in limiting damage by agreeing to cooperate on forensics and controls."
The transnational cyber domain poses new questions about the meaning of national security.
"Some of the most important responses must be national and unilateral, focused on hygiene, redundancy, and resilience."
"It is likely, however, that major governments will soon discover that the insecurity created by non-state cyber actors will require closer cooperation among governments."
समलैंगिक होने की विकास लागत
"लंदन – नाइजीरिया में रहने वाले समलैंगिक व्यक्ति के रूप में, मेरी सबसे बड़ी चुनौती थी, अपनी लिंगीयता और अपने कार्य में से किसी एक का चयन करना।"
"2004 में, मैंने अपने अभिनय कैरियर की शुरूआत की थी। मैंने अभी-अभी विश्वविद्यालय छोड़ा था, और मुझे नाइजीरिया के एक सबसे अधिक लोकप्रिय टीवी स्टेशन, गैलेक्सी टेलीविज़न पर प्राइम टाइम धारावाहिक ""रोज़ेज़ एंड थॉर्न्स"" में मुख्य पात्र के रूप में प्रस्तुत किया गया था। मैं एक अमीर परिवार के इकलौते बेटे ""रिचर्ड"" की भूमिका निभा रहा था, जिसका घर की नौकरानी के साथ प्रेम-प्रसंग चल रहा था।"
"तभी मेरे निजी जीवन के बारे में कानाफूसी होनी शुरू हो गई, और मैंने फ़ैसला कर लिया कि अब इससे बाहर आने का समय आ गया है। इसलिए अपनी लिंगीयता के बारे में चर्चा करने के लिए मैं नाइजीरिया के सबसे ज़्यादा देखे जाने वाले टीवी वार्ता शो पर जाने के लिए राजी हो गया।"
"लगभग तुरंत ही, धारावाहिक से मेरे पात्र को हटा दिया गया। और मेरा कार्य ख़त्म होते ही, मेरी वित्तीय सुरक्षा भी ख़त्म हो गई। अफ़्रीका में अनेक समलैंगिक पुरुषों और महिलाओं की तरह, मुझे आर्थिक स्वतंत्रता और मानसिक कारावास में से किसी एक को चुनना था।"
"इस साल, नाइजीरिया और युगांडा ने समलैंगिकता-विरोधी कठोर क़ानून बनाया है, जिससे दुनिया भर में मानव अधिकारों के बारे में बहस छिड़ गई है। यह बहस विश्व बैंक में भी शुरू हो गई है, जिसके अध्यक्ष, जिम योंग किम ने हाल ही में घोषित किया कि ""सुनियोजित भेदभाव लोगों और समाज के लिए ख़राब है।"""
"किम के इस वक्तव्य की आलोचना हुई है और इससे विवाद पैदा हुआ है। अकसर, जैसा कि युगांडा और नाइजीरिया में होता है, हम इस दावे के बारे में सुनते हैं कि समलिंगी, उभयलिंगी, और विपरीत लिंगी (LGBT) लोगों के ख़िलाफ़ सरकारी स्तर पर भेदभाव का विरोध बस अफ़्रीका पर ""पश्चिमी"" मूल्य थोपने का तरीका मात्र है। लेकिन इसमें यह मान लिया जाता है कि समलैंगिकता ""गैर-अफ़्रीकी"" है। और, इस बात का सबूत न होने के बावजूद कि किसी देश विशेष या महाद्वीप में LGBT लोग नहीं हैं (और इसके विपरीत पर्याप्त सबूत होते हैं), यह एक ऐसी धारणा है जिसे अधिकाधिक अफ़्रीकी नेताओं ने मान्यता दी है।"
"2006 में, राष्ट्रपति ओलुसेगुन ओबासैंजो, जो उस समय नाइजीरिया क��� राष्ट्रपति थे, ऐसा करने वाले व्यक्तियों में पहले व्यक्ति थे। 2014 में समलैंगिकता-विरोधी विधेयक को क़ानून बनाने के लिए हस्ताक्षर करते समय, युगांडा के राष्ट्रपति योवेरी मुसेवेनी ने भी यही किया। गाम्बिया के राष्ट्रपति याह्या जमेह से लेकर जिम्बाब्वे के रॉबर्ट मुगाबे तक, अन्य नेताओं ने भी उसी सुर में बात की।"
"इस तरह के सरकारी नज़रिए ने अफ़्रीका के समलैंगिक पुरुषों और स्त्रियों के लिए बहुत अधिक पीड़ादायक स्थिति पैदा की है। निश्चित रूप से, अनेक अफ़्रीकी देशों में समलैंगिक लोगों के लिए होमोफोबिया की क़ीमत दर्दनाक रूप से स्पष्ट है: क़ानूनी दंड, सामाजिक बहिष्कार, और भीड़ का न्याय।"
"लेकिन अफ़्रीका के समलैंगिकता-विरोधी नेता एक बात भूल जाते हैं: क़ानूनी सुरक्षाएँ देना केवल मानवाधिकारों का मुद्दा ही नहीं है, बल्कि यह आर्थिक मुद्दा भी है। किम की बात बिल्कुल सही है, और शोध ने उन देशों में जहाँ क़ानून और सामाजिक व्यवहार समान सेक्स संबंधों का बहिष्कार किया जाता है, समलैंगिकता-विरोधी भावना और ग़रीबी के बीच संबंधों की खोज के द्वारा, होमोफोबिया की आर्थिक लागत का मूल्यांकन करना शुरू कर दिया है।"
"मैसाचुसेट्स-एमहर्स्ट विश्वविद्यालय के एक अर्थशास्त्री, एम.वी. ली बागेट ने मार्च 2014 में विश्व बैंक की एक बैठक में भारत में होमोफोबिया के आर्थिक प्रभाव पर एक अध्ययन के प्रारंभिक निष्कर्ष प्रस्तुत किए हैं। बागेट का अनुमान है कि भारतीय अर्थव्यवस्था को समलैंगिकता-विरोधी कलंक और भेदभाव से पैदा हुए अवसाद, आत्महत्या, और HIV उपचार असमानताओं के कारण 2012 में केवल प्रत्यक्ष स्वास्थ्य लागतों में $23.1 अरब तक की हानि हुई होगी।"
"ऐसी ठोस लागतों के अलावा, समलैंगिक होने से हिंसा, कार्य की हानि, परिवार की अस्वीकृति, स्कूलों में उत्पीड़न, और शादी करने के लिए दबाव भी आ सकता है। इसके परिणामस्वरूप, अनेक समलैंगिक लोगों की शिक्षा कम होती है, उत्पादकता कम होती है, आय कम होती है, स्वास्थ्य ख़राब होता है, और जीवन-काल कम होता है।"
"नाइजीरिया में, 2005 में अपनी लिंगीयता के बारे में संदेह होने के कारण अपना कार्य खोने वाले लोगों की बढ़ती संख्या के निदान के रूप में मैंने समान अधिकारों के लिए स्वतंत्र परियोजना (TIERS) शुरू की थी। अपने पहले साल के दौरान, हमने दर्जनों लोगों को सहायता प्रदान की। एक युवक ""ओलुमाइड"" को तब अस्थायी आवास दिया गया जब उसके परिवार ने समलैंगिक होने के कारण उसे घर से बाहर निकाल दिया था। एक अन्य व्यक्ति ""उछे"" को उसकी लिंगीयता का राज़ खुलने के बाद उसे बावर्ची की नौकरी से निकाल दिया गया था। TIERS ने उसे आवास दिया और केटरिंग व्यवसाय स्थापित करने के लिए पूँजी की मदद की। हालाँकि लगभग 10 साल बीत चुके हैं, लेकिन उनके असली नाम का उपयोग करना अभी भी सुरक्षित नहीं है।"
"पूरे अफ़्रीका में, नियोक्ताओं, मकान-मालिकों, स्वास्थ्य-सेवा प्रदाताओं, शैक्षिक संस्थानों, और अन्य लोगों पर LGBT लोगों को बाहर करने के लिए बढ़ते दबाव के कारण भेदभाव की आर्थिक लागत बढ़ रही है।"
"आज, विश्व बैंक और अन्य विकास एजेंसियाँ उन वैश्विक विकास प्राथमिकताओं का निर्धारण कर रही हैं जिन्हें सहस्राब्दि विकास लक्ष्यों (MDGs) की समाप्ति के बाद लिया जाएगा, जो आधिकारिक तौर पर 2015 में समाप्त हो जाएँगे और लैंगिक समानता को बढ़ावा देने और आर्थिक विकास के लिए रणनीति के रूप में महिलाओं को सशक्त बनाने के लिए विशिष्ट लक्ष्यों को शामिल किया है। भविष्य पर नज़र रखते हुए, विश्व बैंक को LGBT अधिकारों के लिए भी वही दृष्टिकोण अपनाना चाहिए और ऋण प्राप्त करने वाले देशों के लिए लिंगीयता और लैंगिक पहचान के लिए क़ानूनी सुरक्षाओं की शर्त रखनी चाहिए।"
"MDG में महिलाओं के अधिकारों को मान्यता प्रदान किए जाने के फलस्वरूप ""पश्चिमी"" मूल्यों को लागू करने से अफ़्रीकी संस्कृतियाँ दूषित नहीं हुईं; वास्तव में, इसने अनेक अफ़्रीकी देशों को मज़बूत बनाया है, जो अब सरकार में महिलाओं के प्रतिनिधित्व में दुनिया का नेतृत्व करते हैं। LGBT लोगों के लिए इसी तरह की सुरक्षा प्रदान करके, अंतर्राष्ट्रीय निवेश और सहायता से आर्थिक निष्पादन में सुधार हो सकता है और बुनियादी मानव अधिकारों के लिए सम्मान को मज़बूत किया जा सकता है।"
"विश्व बैंक ने, जो हमेशा ""राजनीतिक"" सवालों में उलझने से बचने के प्रति सावधान रहता है, इस बात पर ज़ोर दिया है कि वह वैश्विक मानवाधिकार प्रवर्तक नहीं है। लेकिन विश्व बैंक अपने सदस्यों को उनके मानव अधिकारों के दायित्वों को साकार करने में मदद करके अपनी मददगार की भूमिका को भी अधिकाधिक पहचान रहा है। LGBT अधिकारों का मामला एक कसौटी के रूप में होना चाहिए।"
"ऐसी सरकारों को सहायता देने के फलस्वरूप, जो विशिष्ट सामाजिक समूहों का बहिष्कार करने की अनुमति देती हैं, वास्तविक आर्थिक लागत बहुत अधिक हो सकती है। नए ऋणों पर विचार करते समय यह सुनिश्चित करने के लिए क़दम उठाए जाने चाहिए कि लाभ यथासंभव समावेशी हों।"
"अगर विश्व बैंक - जो वर्तमान में नाइजीरिया को लगभग $5.5 अरब का ऋण दे रहा है और यह उम्मीद है कि यह अगले चार सालों में हर साल अतिरिक्त $2 अरब के लिए वचन देगा - इस दिशा में कार्रवाई करता है, तो हो सकता है कि अन्य वित्तदाता भी उसका अनुसरण करें। अफ़्रीका के LGBT लोगों को अपने मानव और आर्थिक अधिकारों के लिए संघर्ष में ऐसे शक्तिशाली सहयोगियों की सख़्त ज़रूरत है।"
A Declaration of Independence from the US
"George W. Bush is obsessed with the war on terrorism, especially with the military response to terrorism."
American foreign policy reflects that obsession.
"This year, the US will spend around $450 billion for the military, including the costs of the Iraq War, while it will spend no more than $15 billion to overcome global poverty, global environmental degradation, and global diseases."
"In other words, US foreign policy spending is thirty times more focused on the military than on building global prosperity, global public health, and a sustainable environment."
"Throughout 2003, the world lived with Bush's obsession."
"Debate over Iraq dominated international diplomacy, and took up almost the entire UN agenda."
"The war in Iraq cost countless innocent lives, such as when the UN headquarters in Baghdad was bombed."
"At the same time, Bush's emphasis on a one-dimensional, militarized approach to global problems has fueled unrest and instability throughout the Islamic world, leading to increased terrorism in Turkey, North Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Southeast Asia."
The nature of suffering around the world hardly justifies this narrow strategy.
"Focusing on terrorism to the exclusion of other issues, and emphasizing the military response to it, will not bring prosperity and peace, or even a significant reduction in the number of attacks."
"While 3,000 innocent people died in the US on September 11, 2001, in Africa 8,000 innocent children die every day from malaria."
Yet malaria is preventable and treatable.
The problem is that most of Africa is too poor to mobilize the methods of prevention (bed nets) and treatments (anti-malarial medicines) that could save millions of children every year.
The US spends more on Iraq each day than it does on Africa's malaria in a year.
"As 2003 draws to a close, it is time for world leaders to help guide the world away from the obsessive, failing approach of America's government."
"President Bush should be made to understand that the US will find no true international support if America speaks incessantly about terrorism while doing almost nothing about the problems that really affect most of the world: poverty, lack of access to safe water and sanitation, vulnerability to disease, and climate change."
"Ironically, President Bush claims that the UN does not follow through on its word."
"He declared in London recently that ""the credibility of the UN depends on a willingness to keep its word and to act when action is required."""
Yet the US repeatedly violates its own UN pledges.
"For example, at the International Conference on Financing for Development, in Monterrey, Mexico in March 2002, America signed the Monterrey Consensus, which includes a promise by rich countries to raise their development assistance towards 0.7% of national income."
That would bring an additional $60 billion per year in foreign assistance from the US--approximately what it spent on Iraq this year.
Yet President Bush has simply ignored this promise.
There are many other similar commitments that the US has made in recent years to the UN that remain utterly unfulfilled.
The US promised action to fight man-made climate change as a signatory to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) in 1992.
It has so far failed to act.
America also promised--in the Doha Declaration in 2001--to open its markets to the world's poorest countries.
"Yet at Cancun, Mexico earlier this summer, it refused to open its markets even to exports from struggling African economies."
The list goes on and on.
"At the Millennium Assembly in 2000, the US promised to pursue reduction of global poverty, yet it has taken few steps in that direction."
"At the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002, America committed itself to protect global ecosystems, yet little has been seen or heard from US policy makers on this issue since then."
America is certainly not alone in failing to promote the international goals adopted in the UN.
"But because the US is the richest, most powerful country in the world, its neglect is devastating."
"If the US really wants to undercut terrorism, it must recognize the interconnectedness of extremism, poverty, and environmental degradation, and it will need to understand the struggles for survival that are underway among the poor everywhere."
But the world should not wait for the America to come to its senses.
"The US represents just 5% of the world's population, and just one vote of 191 countries in the UN General Assembly."
"Poor countries, especially the democracies of the developing world--Brazil, South Africa, India, Mexico, Ghana, the Philippines--should say, ""We need to act on the issues that concern us, not just on the issues that concern the US."""
What the world needs most in 2004 is a declaration of independence from American willfulness.
A De-Globalized World?
"Cambridge – It may take a few months or a couple of years, but one way or another the United States and other advanced economies will eventually recover from today’s crisis."
"The world economy, however, is unlikely to look the same."
"Even with the worst of the crisis over, we are likely to find ourselves in a somewhat de-globalized world, one in which international trade grows at a slower pace, there is less external finance, and rich countries’ appetite for running large current-account deficits is significantly diminished."
Will this spell doom for developing countries?
Not necesarily.
Growth in the developing world tends to come in three distinct variants.
First comes growth driven by foreign borrowing.
Second is growth as a by-product of commodity booms.
Third is growth led by economic restructuring and diversification into new products.
The first two models are at greater risk than the third.
"But we should not lose sleep over them, because they are flawed and ultimately unsustainable."
What should be of greater concern is the potential plight of countries in the last group.
These countries will need to undertake major changes in their policies to adjust to today’s new realities.
The first two growth models invariably come to a bad end.
"Foreign borrowing can enable consumers and governments to live beyond their means for a while, but reliance on foreign capital is an unwise strategy."
"The problem is not only that foreign capital flows can easily reverse direction, but also that they produce the wrong kind of growth, based on overvalued currencies and investments in non-traded goods and services, such as housing and construction."
"Growth driven by high commodity prices is also susceptible to busts, for similar reasons. Commodity prices tend to move in cycles."
"When they are high, they are apt to crowd out investments in manufactures and other, non-traditional tradables."
"Moreover, commodity booms frequently produce ugly politics in countries with weak institutions, leading to costly struggles for resource rents, which are rarely invested wisely."
"So it is no surprise that the countries that have produced steady, long-term growth during the last six decades are those that relied on a different strategy: promoting diversification into manufactured and other “modern” goods."
"By capturing a growing share of world markets for manufactures and other non-primary products, these countries increased their domestic employment opportunities in high-productivity activities."
"Their governments pursued not just good “fundamentals” (e.g., macroeconomic stability and an outward orientation), but also what might be called “productivist” policies: undervalued currencies, industrial policies, and financial controls."
China exemplified this approach.
Its growth was fueled by an extraordinarily rapid structural transformation towards an increasingly sophisticated set of industrial goods.
"In recent years, China also got hooked on a large trade surplus vis-à-vis the US – the counterpart of its undervalued currency."
But it wasn’t just China.
Countries that had been growing rapidly in the run-up to the great crash of 2008 typically had trade surpluses (or very small deficits).
"These countries did not want to be recipients of capital inflows, because they realized that this would wreak havoc with their need to maintain competitive currencies."
It is now part of conventional wisdom that large external balances – typified by the bilateral US-China trade relationship – played a major contributing role in the great crash.
Global macroeconomic stability requires that we avoid such large current-account imbalances in the future.
But a return to high growth in developing countries requires that they resume their push into tradable goods and services.
"In the past, this push was accommodated by the willingness of the US and a few other developed nations to run large trade deficits."
This is no longer a feasible strategy for large or middle-income developing countries.
"So, are the requirements of global macroeconomic stability and of growth for developing countries at odds with each other?"
Will developing countries’ need to generate large increases in the supply of industrial products inevitably clash with the world’s intolerance of trade imbalances?
"There is in fact no inherent conflict, once we understand that what matters for growth in developing countries is not the size of their trade surpluses, nor even the volume of their exports."
"What matters is their output of modern industrial goods (and services), which can expand without limit as long as domestic demand expands simultaneously."
Maintaining an undervalued currency has the upside that it subsidizes the production of such goods; but it also has the downside that it taxes domestic consumption – which is why it generates a trade surplus.
"By encouraging industrial production directly, it is possible to have the upside without the downside."
"There are many ways that this can be done, including reducing the cost of domestic inputs and services through targeted investments in infrastructure."
Explicit industrial policies can be an even more potent instrument.
The key point is that developing countries that are concerned about the competitiveness of their modern sectors can afford to allow their currencies to appreciate (in real terms) as long as they have access to alternative policies that promote industrial activities more directly.
So the good news is that developing countries can continue to grow rapidly even if world trade slows in and there is reduced appetite for capital flows and trade imbalances.
Their growth potential need not be severely affected as long as the implications of this new world for domestic and international policies are understood.
One such implication is that developing countries will have to substitute real industrial policies for those that operate through the exchange rate.
"Another is that external policy actors (for example, the World Trade Organization) will have to be more tolerant of these policies as long as the effects on trade balances are neutralized through appropriate adjustments in the real exchange rate."
Greater use of industrial policies is the price to be paid for a reduction of macroeconomic imbalances.
A Democratic Windfall for Turkey?
Turkey's seeming fall from grace with the US may turn out to be a blessing in disguise.
"The Iraq war and the tortured diplomacy that led up to it may help resolve Turkey's conflict between its ""strategic alliance"" with America and its drive to join the EU."
The elections last November that brought the Justice and Development Party (AKP) to power were preceded by a dispute between the members of the then-ruling coalition over enacting the reforms demanded by the EU.
"Some liberal elements of that ""secular"" coalition resigned from the government and joined with the Islamists to push the reforms through parliament."
"After coming to power, the AKP's leaders, former Islamists who had reinvented themselves as ""conservative democrats,"" energetically engaged with the US, the EU, and the UN on issues ranging from Cyprus to Iraq, from Kurdish language rights to other human rights issues within Turkey."
"Having suffered the oppressive practices of Turkey's ""secular"" state and recognizing that human rights must be protected across-the-board, the AKP emerged as a credible interlocutor with the West."
"The US, preoccupied with the supposed specter of a ""clash of civilizations"" between Islam and the West, saw the AKP's modern, westernized face as an opportunity and urged the EU to admit Turkey."
"Today, both ""conservative democrats"" and liberals advocate passing all the reforms needed to gain accession to the EU, while opponents include extreme nationalists, of both left and right, as well as some elements of the ""secular"" establishment."
The Europeans could have tipped the balance decisively in favor of the reformers by finally rewarding the efforts of the pro-EU Turks at last December's summit of EU leaders.
"Instead, the EU kept Turkey waiting yet again, putting off formal negotiations that, in any case, may take years to complete."
Europe's persistent reluctance puts the Turks in a quandary.
The Americans want full EU membership for Turkey--a longstanding NATO member and close American ally--while Europeans complain about the Turkish military's domestic political role.
"The paradox is that, by maintaining a political distance and thus limiting Turkey's options, Europe may end up reinforcing Turkey's status as a military outpost of the US."
"At least, that was how things were shaping up prior to the war in Iraq."
"Then, despite massive US pressure, Turkey's parliament unexpectedly rejected the government's proposal to allow US troops in Turkey to launch an invasion from Turkish territory."
Turkey's refusal to grant the Americans access to military bases on its territory effectively ruled out a northern front in the war.
"The Turkish government even attempted a regional initiative for a peaceful solution to the crisis, an effort no current EU member could have contemplated."
Parliament's rejection of US troops powerfully refutes suggestions that Turkey was primarily concerned about the size of the American aid package on offer as an inducement to cooperate.
"Suggestions that characterized the vote as revealing the government's true ""Islamic"" character ignore the fact that the only opposition party in parliament, the Republican People's Party--founded by Atatürk and still fully ""secularist""--voted against the plan."
"Likewise, other elements of Turkey's secular establishment, including the President and the military leadership, either opposed or were lukewarm, at best, to the idea of war in Iraq."
"Turkey's military initially remained silent on the issue, uncharacteristically watching the civilian political process unfold."
"By contrast, the military had earlier publicly criticized AKP initiatives on Cyprus."
"Their silence on Iraq reflected their apprehension about unwanted alternatives: either support the US plan and risk encouraging Kurdish moves toward an independent state, or oppose the Americans and jeopardize a critical strategic relationship."
"They chose to defer to the civilian leadership and to parliament, which, in voting down the US plan, reflected overwhelming public sentiment against the war."
Only after the vote did the Chief of Staff publicly endorse the original proposal to bring in American troops.
"In fact, the allegedly Islamic party had skilfully managed to negotiate with an unrelenting US, consult with the Turkish military and President, and share all information with the public and parliament."
"Walking a fine line in what was essentially a lose-lose situation, the party leadership laid out the stakes clearly and judiciously left the final decision to parliament."
The outcome was a victory for Turkish democracy and recognized as such internationally.
"After the US military action in Iraq, the tables may be turning in surprising ways."
"As America establishes itself in Iraq, Turkey's geopolitical military significance may decline."
Yet the declared American aim of building a Muslim democracy in Iraq will only enhance Turkey's symbolic importance as a role model.
This shift in Turkey's strategic role may also be reflected in a new domestic balance between the military and the forces pushing for reform.
"With careful management, Turkey may find itself drawing closer to Europe, while rebuilding its relationship with America."
A Dim Light on Global Warming
"COPENHAGEN – Amid a growing wave of concern about climate change, many countries – including Brazil, Australia, the United States, and the members of the European Union – passed laws in the 2000’s outlawing or severely restricting access to incandescent light bulbs."
"The intention was understandable: if everyone in the world exchanged most light bulbs for energy-efficient compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs), we could save 3.5% of all electricity, or 1% of our CO2 emissions."
The current attempt by Republicans in the US Congress to roll back America’s effort to ban incandescent bulbs has revived this discussion.
Many contend that the agenda is being driven by knuckle-dragging climate-change deniers.
But it’s worth taking a closer look at the premise that banning things is the smartest way to tackle global warming.
Let’s be clear: we do need to tackle climate change.
But this does not mean that we should just cut all emissions.
"Burning fossil fuels also has significant benefits, and we should weigh those benefits against the costs."
A tax on carbon should be equivalent to its damage.
The best estimate of this is about $7/ton of CO2 or $0.06/gallon of gasoline (€0.015/liter).
"Most developed countries already have a tax of this size (and often much larger) on electricity and fossil fuels, although this also incorporates the costs of air pollution and supply insecurity."
"While CFLs are more expensive to buy, they are much cheaper over their lifespan, because they use much less energy (even more so with the cost of CO2 factored into taxes on electricity)."
"Thus, on a straightforward cost-benefit basis, it seems to make sense for most people to switch from incandescent bulbs to the new, greener technology."
"This is what is great about technological solutions to climate change: if an alternative option is cheaper, people will start using it."
"My household uses CFLs, and I enjoy knowing that I am causing fewer CO2 emissions and spending less money."
"Why, then, is it even necessary to outlaw the old bulbs?"
The reason is that monetary cost is only one factor.
Many people find it annoying that CFLs take time to “warm up.”
Or they believe that their light is “funny.”
Or they worry that the bulbs can spread poisonous mercury if they break.
"For some people, energy-efficient bulbs can trigger epileptic seizures and migraines."
"The up-front cost is a factor, too, especially for those on low budgets."
"And in places where lights are not used very often, a lower-price incandescent bulb can cost less overall than the energy-efficient alternative."
You might imagine that people could choose the right light bulbs for themselves.
But proponents of phasing out access to incandescent bulbs argue that they know better.
"As US Energy Secretary Steven Chu put it recently, “We are taking away a choice that continues to let people waste their own money.”"
"Setting aside other possible objections to this view, there is the problem that it presumes that all incandescent bulbs are worth less than $7/ton of CO2."
"This is clearly not true for those who suffer from migraines or epileptic seizures because of the new bulbs, or for those who are seriously worried about mercury, or for those who have other reasons for preferring incandescent bulbs."
"The solution should be to focus on improving the technology – making the lights safer, brighter, warm up faster, and save more energy, so that more people will replace more of their lights."
But it is not just light bulbs that policymakers have tried to ban.
"EU parliamentarians voted overwhelmingly to outlaw patio heaters, which one MEP declared to be “a luxury the planet cannot afford.”"
Who decides when something is luxurious?
And where does this end?
Should we outlaw air conditioning or television satellite boxes because some people find them luxurious?
Should we ban private cars wherever public transport is available to move us from A to B with fewer CO2 emissions?
"It makes sense to reflect the cost of CO2 (among many other factors) in the price paid to drive our cars or heat our patios; but when the phase-out proceeds more slowly than some lawmakers wish, a ban is not the right solution."
Real reductions in carbon emissions will occur only when better technology makes it worthwhile for individuals and businesses to change their behavior.
"CFLs and other advances can take us part of the way, but there are massive technological hurdles to overcome before fossil fuels generally become less attractive than greener alternatives."
This is where a lot of policymakers get it wrong.
"Governments talk far too much about setting a relatively high carbon tax on emissions, while focusing far too little on ensuring a meaningful increase in research and development to bring about necessary breakthroughs."
"Limiting access to the ‘wrong’ light bulbs or patio heaters, ultimately, is not the right path."
We will only solve global warming by ensuring that alternative technologies are better than our current options.
"Then, people the world over will choose to use them."
A Dissident in China
TOKYO – 2009 was a good year for China.
The Chinese economy still roared ahead in the midst of a worldwide recession.
"American President Barack Obama visited China, more in the spirit of a supplicant to an imperial court than the leader of the world’s greatest superpower."
"Even the Copenhagen summit on climate change ended just the way China wanted: failure in its attempt to commit China, or any other industrial nation, to making significant cuts in carbon emissions, with the United States getting the blame."
"The Chinese government, under the Communist Party, has every reason to feel confident."
"So why did a gentle former literature professor named Liu Xiaobo have to be sentenced to 11 years in prison, just because he publicly advocated freedom of expression and an end to one-party rule?"
"Liu was co-author in 2008 of a petition, Charter 08, signed by thousands of Chinese, calling for basic rights to be respected."
Liu is not a violent rebel.
"His opinions, in articles published on the Internet, are entirely peaceful."
Yet he was jailed for “inciting subversion of state power.”
The notion that Liu might be capable of subverting the immense power of the Communist Party of China is patently absurd.
"And yet the authorities clearly believe that they had to make an example of him, to prevent others from expressing similar views."
"Why does a regime that appears to be so secure consider mere opinions, or even peaceful petitions, so dangerous?"
Perhaps because the regime does not feel as secure as it looks.
"Without legitimacy, no government can rule with any sense of confidence."
There are many ways to legitimize political arrangements.
Liberal democracy is only a recent invention.
"Hereditary monarchy, often backed by divine authority, has worked in the past."
"And some modern autocrats, such as Robert Mugabe, have been bolstered by their credentials as national freedom fighters."
"China has changed a great deal in the last century, but it has remained the same in one respect: it is still ruled by a religious concept of politics."
"Legitimacy is not based on the give and take, the necessary compromises, and the wheeling and dealing that form the basis of an economic concept of politics such as that which underpins liberal democracy."
"Instead, the foundation of religious politics is a shared belief, imposed from above, in ideological orthodoxy."
"In imperial China, this meant Confucian orthodoxy."
The ideal of the Confucian state is “harmony.”
"If all people conform to a particular set of beliefs, including moral codes of behavior, conflicts will disappear."
"The ruled, in this ideal system, will naturally obey their rulers, just as sons obey their fathers."
"After the various revolutions in the early decades of the twentieth century, Confucianism was replaced by a Chinese version of Communism."
"Marxism appealed to Chinese intellectuals, because it was bookish, introduced a modern moral orthodoxy, and was based, like Confucianism, on a promise of perfect harmony."
"Ultimately, in the Communist utopia, conflicts of interests would melt away."
Chairman Mao’s rule combined elements of the Chinese imperial system with Communist totalitarianism.
"This orthodoxy, however, was also destined to fade away."
"Few Chinese, even in the top ranks of the Communist Party, are convinced Marxists anymore."
"This left an ideological vacuum, swiftly filled in the 1980’s by greed, cynicism, and corruption."
"Out of this crisis came the demonstrations all over China, collectively known as “Tiananmen.”"
Liu Xiaobo was an active spokesman in 1989 for the student protests against official corruption and in favor of greater freedom.
"Soon after the bloody crackdown on Tiananmen, a new orthodoxy replaced Chinese Marxism: Chinese nationalism."
Only one-party rule would guarantee the continuing rise of China and put an end to centuries of national humiliation.
The Communist Party represented China’s destiny as a great power.
"To doubt this was not just mistaken, but unpatriotic, even “anti-Chinese.”"
"From this perspective, Liu Xiaobo’s critical views were indeed subversive."
"They cast doubt on the official orthodoxy, and thus on the legitimacy of the state."
"To wonder, as many have, why the Chinese regime refused to negotiate with the students in 1989 – or to find some accommodation with its critics today – is to misunderstand the nature of religious politics."
"Negotiation, compromise, and accommodation are the marks of economic politics, where every deal has its price."
"By contrast, those who rule according to a shared belief cannot afford to negotiate, for that would undermine the belief itself."
"This is not to say that the economic concept of politics is utterly strange to the Chinese – or, for that matter, that the religious notion of politics is unknown in the democratic West."
But the insistence on orthodoxy is still sufficiently strong in China to remain the default defense against political critics.
These things can change.
"Other Confucian societies, such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, now have thriving liberal democracies, and there is no reason to believe that such a transition is impossible in China."
But external pressure is unlikely to bring it about.
"Many non-Chinese, including me, have signed a letter of protest against the jailing of Liu Xiaobo."
"One hopes that this will lend comfort to him, and give a moral boost to Chinese who share his views."
But it is unlikely to impress those who believe in the current orthodoxy of Chinese nationalism.
"Until China is released from the grip of religious politics, Liu’s ideals are unlikely to take root."
"This does not bode well for China, or, indeed, for the rest of the world."
A Doomsday Scenario
"As America debates whether or not to invade Iraq, fears that the country's economic recovery will stall are beginning to creep into the discussion; with that, worries about the health of the global economy are growing, too."
A consensus is emerging that the gap between the US economy's growth potential and its actual performance will remain large for some time to come.
Can the situation get worse?
"Yes, it can: much worse."
A number of worrying factors about the US economy have been around for a long time:
huge trade deficits have persisted since Ronald Reagan's misguided tax cuts of 1981 converted America from the world's largest creditor into the world's largest debtor.
"Today, these deficits set new records by the month;"
America's appallingly low savings rate.
"When American wealth seemed to be growing year after year as the stock market boomed, this was understandable; individual Americans were becoming richer without savings, so why bother?"
"Today's savings rate, while it has increased slightly, still finds America at the bottom of the world's savings league tables;"
lax accounting standards.
"The Arthur Anderson, Enron, and WorldCom scandals didn't emerge out of thin air, but had their origins in the mid-1990s, when the US Treasury actually intervened to stop attempts by the supposedly independent accounting standards board to improve matters."
Bad accounting contributed to the recent stock market bubble; bad information led to stock prices that did not reflect underlying realities; and these in turn provided incentives for the excess investment in telecoms that caused today's excess capacity.
"To this old brew, new ingredients have been added, notably the most rapid change in a nation's fiscal posture the world has probably ever seen."
"In a ""now you see it, now you don't"" move only a magician should love, the $3 trillion, ten year (non social security) US budget surplus was - in a matter of months - converted into a gaping"
"Of course, excuses are at hand: the magnitude of the economic downturn was not anticipated and the increased expenditures to fight terrorism could not be foretold."
"Excuses, excuses."
As the old saying goes: Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
"The Bush Administration not only counted its chickens, it sold them forward!"
"To anyone with decent eyesight, it was clear that the rosy budget projections of two years ago were nonsense."
"Clear, too, was the fact that, in promoting its tax cuts, the Bush Administration was engaging (on a multi-billion dollar scale) in dishonest, Enron-like accounting."
"So if things are so bad now, how can they get worse?"
Here's a plausible scenario.
"To finance its trade deficit, America must borrow from abroad over a billion dollars a day."
"When America was the only safe haven for global investors, this was easy."
But America today appears less safe.
"The combination of lack of confidence in US corporate accounts, lack of confidence in America's economic policy management (compounded by the mounting deficits), and America's soft underlying economic fundamentals, has dented the US economy's global reputation."
"As foreigners start pulling their money out of a country they suspect, the dollar will weaken."
"As the dollar weakens, America looks even less safe."
So a rush to the door begins.
"While a weak dollar may be good for exports, a falling dollar will be accompanied by stock market losses and greater declines in confidence."
"Eventually, even the almighty American consumer will be shaken and realize that he is poorer today than three years ago and that he better start putting money away for his retirement, especially given Bush's proposed risky experiments with the social security system."
"At that point, Americans will join the stampede out of their economy."
Why shouldn't they?
They're free to choose where to put their money.
Europe's stock markets will begin to look like an attractive alternative.
But this scenario offers no happy ending for Europe.
A weakening US economy and the strengthening Euro will dampen European exports.
"The European Central Bank, fixated on inflation, will be slow to lower interest rates, and the European Stability Pact will make it impossible for fiscal policy to offset these weaknesses."
"Europe will join America in a downturn, reinforcing America's decline and setting in motion a global downward spiral."
I am not predicting that this will happen.
I hope that the Bush Administration will enact policies to strengthen the US economy: a tax cut that might made minimal sense when it
"America is strong, and the global economy is strong."
"Should the disastrous events contemplated here occur, a new global economy will eventually emerge from the ashes."
"Downturns, of course, can never be fully prevented. We can, however, decrease their frequency; we can make them shallower; we can ensure that fewer people are hurt and that those that get hurt are better protected."
"Sadly, we are doing less than is possible to prevent things from getting worse and doing less than necessary to protect ourselves from the consequences."
A Double-Dip Recession for the US?
"Last winter, America's central bank - the Federal Reserve - was busy patting itself on the back."
The Fed's cut in its basic interest rate to 1.75% per year seemed to have worked: the recession was ending.
"Despite sobered expectations about the high-tech revolution's impact on productivity and profits, as well as the jitters inspired by the terror attack on the World Trade Center, American businesses, it was believed, would soon start investing again big-time because borrowing money at 1.75% was too good a deal to pass up."
"By late spring, those expectations had disintegrated alongside the collapse of Enron, WorldCom, and Arthur Andersen."
"Suddenly, everyone doubted the integrity of the financial accounts of American companies."
"Suddenly, everyone saw just how much America's system of corporate surveillance and control had deteriorated during the bubble of the 1990s."
The American stock market fell 15-20% below its winter levels.
Spreads between the interest rate at which America's government could borrow and the interest rates at which America's corporations could borrow widened.
"Suddenly, the Fed stopped congratulating itself: a 1.75% interest rate might be the right interest rate to fuel a recovery when the Dow-Jones stock market index stands at 10,000, but not when the Dow-Jones index stands at 8,500."
"Throughout the summer, corporate investment news remained disappointing."
"More and more analysts began to speak about the possibility of a ""double dip"" recession."
"Yet throughout all this, the Federal Reserve remained passive."
The short-term interest rates it controlled didn't budge.
Only in mid-August did the Fed hint that interest rates might be cut.
The informal and unofficial rationale leaking out of the Fed for its inaction had two parts.
"First, short-term interest rates were already so low that everyone would see further cuts as temporary only."
They would thus have little effect on the longer-term rates that really drive business investment.
"Second, short-term interest rates were so low that additional cuts would spook the financial markets: if even the Fed thought conditions warranted cuts, the argument went, businesses would respond not by increasing their investments but by reducing them."
"The Fed's judgment appeared to be that it was largely (if not completely) powerless: it had done all that it could, and the levers of monetary policy were no longer strongly connected to determining the level of economic activity."
So the US in 2002 joined Japan in what economists have for sixty-five years called a Liquidity Trap: a situation in which the short-term nominal interest rates the central bank controls are so low and so loosely connected to the level of aggregate demand that further reductions are ineffective in fighting a recession.
America's situation was not unique: Japan had been in been in thrall to a liquidity trap since the mid-1990s. But there had been no other examples since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Whether America now really is in a liquidity trap is uncertain.
How long this state of affairs will last is unknown.
"Nevertheless, even if America is only on the edge of a liquidity trap, and even if it moves away from the current state of affairs soon, this is a frightening situation."
"If monetary policy is not effective, the only lever the American government has to manage its economy is fiscal policy: changes in the government's tax and spending plans to change the government's direct contribution to aggregate demand."
"But the lesson of the decades since World War II is that the US government - with its complex, baroque, eighteenth-century organization - is incapable of changing policy fast enough to make effective use of fiscal policy as a tool for managing the economy."
It simply takes too long for changes in taxes and spending to work their way through Congress and the bureaucracy.
"An America caught in a liquidity trap is, quite simply, a country with no effective tools of macroeconomic management."
"There have been two eras since World War II when policymakers - American policymakers, at least - believed that they had solved the riddle of the business cycle and had learned how to manage a modern industrial or post-industrial economy."
The first was the Keynesian high-water mark of confidence in demand management of the 1960s. It was destroyed by the inflation of the Vietnam era and the oil-price shocks of the 1970s.
"The second was the decade of successful business-cycle management by Alan Greenspan's independent, apolitical, and technocratic Fed during the 1990s."
This second era now appears to have been as fleeting as the first.
"Eighty years ago, John Maynard Keynes argued that governments needed to take responsibility for maintaining full employment and price stability - that the pre-World War I gold standard had not been the golden age people thought it was, and that its successes were the result of a lucky combination of circumstances unlikely to be repeated."
Keynes was an optimist in believing that governments could learn to manage the business cycle.
"He would be shocked to look at today's world: a Europe with stubbornly high unemployment, a Japan mired in a decade of near stagnation, and now an America lacking the policy tools to deal with any additional unexpected economic bad news."
A Drug War on Auto-Pilot
"THE HAGUE – The war in Afghanistan, now approaching its tenth year, may seem to many to have no end in sight, but Latin America has endured an even longer fight, one that has recently become much more bloody: the “war” against drug trafficking."
So rote – and so violent – has that war become that many people in Latin America now wonder which side is suffering the more pathological addiction.
"The new strategy that US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been promoting to staunch the upward trend of narco-trafficking-related murders – which leaked Mexican government reports put at more than 22,000 since late 2006 – is to build “stronger, more resilient communities.”"
"Ciudad Juárez, a sprawling Mexican border town that is now the homicide capital of the world, would have to be high on the list."
"Four bridges and innumerable tunnels and drainage canals connect Ciudad Juárez and El Paso, Texas."
"Rival cartels sparring for control of a plaza, the name given to any trafficking route, butcher each other and the security forces."
"There is apparently no shortage of young, unemployed men willing to join the carnage."
"Addressing the deep-seated social and economic problems of a city like Juárez, however, is a lot harder than flooding its streets with 8,000 soldiers carrying assault rifles."
"Mexican President Felipe Calderón has, in this respect, remained faithful to the script written in previous theaters in the drug war, whether in Bolivia, Colombia, or Peru, where governments have used military force and extradition to placate the US and punish those with the least voice and influence."
But the language used by the Obama administration to describe the violence and state corruption that snakes from the Andes to the US border is starting to capture new thinking on narcotics.
"Three former Latin American presidents, Mexico’s second richest man, Ricardo Salinas, and the Supreme Court of Argentina, among others, have criticized the war on drugs as a manifest failure that has lowered street prices, fueled production, and undermined weak states."
"More strikingly, both Bolivia and Ecuador are governed by presidents who suffered directly from the collateral insensitivities of the war on drugs."
"Bolivia’s Evo Morales rose to prominence as leader of the country’s coca growers during a brutal campaign to wipe out their crops, the so-called Dignity Plan."
Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa’s father was jailed for smuggling drugs to the US when the future leader was five years old.
"These leaders’ profound ambivalence toward the goal of a world free of illegal drugs is shared by the European Union, where restrictions on narcotics consumption have slackened over the past decade."
"The past three US presidents, furthermore, have all admitted to consuming – to one extent or another – illegal psychoactive substances, while seven million Americans, according to the United Nations, are regular cocaine users."
"But the inertia of a bureaucratic drug-enforcement superstructure (worth approximately $40 billion each in the US and the EU), sustained by a deep-seated fear of the “threat” posed by drugs and cartels, appears to push policy repeatedly towards the familiar option of repressive auto-pilot."
"For example, US support for Mexico’s campaign against the cartels looks set in stone, with Congress apparently ready to provide $300 million for another year of military and security upgrading."
"In Colombia, seven new joint military installations are planned, and support for US private contractors who have cornered the market in crop fumigation presumably will not be interrupted."
"Nevertheless, as the flaws in the four-decade-old edifice of counter-narcotics become more visible, it is increasingly difficult to regard the risks of drug use as being greater than the damage done by repression."
"Prohibition hikes the mark-up on prices – an astounding 15,000% in the case of cocaine traveling to Europe from Andean processing facilities."
"While the war on drugs focuses on bringing down cartels and their kingpins, it perversely aids the health of their markets, which nestle within legitimate trade flows and respond to price incentives."
"Interviewed by the Mexican magazine Proceso this year, the second-in-command of the giant Sinaloa cartel, Ismael Zambada, made the point clearly: “The narco problem involves millions of people."
How do you control it?
"The capos can be jailed, killed, or extradited, but their replacements are already wandering around.”"
The emergence of Latin America’s powerful drug mafias cannot be traced to the radical evil of certain individuals.
"These people emerged under conditions created in deeply inequitable societies by a misapplied, inconsistent, and bureaucratic war."
"Indeed, the furies of the Zetas in Mexico originate in the counter-insurgency training provided in the 1990’s to a select group of special-forces soldiers, who later deserted."
"The Zetas’ star recruits in recent years have come from the Guatemalan military’s special forces, whose infamous induction technique involved biting off the head of a live chicken."
"Meanwhile, in Jamaica and across the rural outposts of Central America, drug lords have become benefactors and heroes to the poor."
"It is time for serious reconsideration of the status and regulation of illegal drugs, pointing to selective legalization, as well as reclassification of the market as a public-health, rather than a criminal, concern."
"For now, policymakers across the Americas are tiptoeing towards the obvious."
A Global \
ATHENS – The International Monetary Fund’s belated admission that it significantly underestimated the damage that austerity would do to European Union growth rates highlights the self-defeating character of “orthodox” recipes to address the causes of the debt crisis that followed the financial crash of 2008-2009.
"Conventional theory suggests that a single country (or group of countries) consolidating its finances can expect lower interest rates, a weaker currency, and an improved trade position."
"But, because this cannot happen for all major economies simultaneously – one country’s (or group of countries’) austerity implies less demand for other countries’ products – such policies eventually lead to beggar-thy-neighbor situations."
"Indeed, it was this dynamic – against which John Maynard Keynes fought – that made the Great Depression of the 1930’s so grim."
Today’s problems are compounded by a lack of sufficient private demand – particularly household consumption – in the advanced economies to compensate for demand losses stemming from austerity.
"During the last two decades, consumption drove these countries’ economic growth, reaching historically high GDP shares."
"Moreover, major advanced economies, such as the United States, Germany, and Japan, face longer-term fiscal problems in the form of aging populations or oversize welfare states, limiting their capacity to contribute to demand management."
"Recent moves to ease monetary policy have been a step in the right direction; but, so far, they have not proved to be a game changer."
"For domestic demand to act as an engine of growth, policies should shift resources from investment to consumption."
"While the magnitudes involved are huge, they must be attained if an extended period of low growth, high unemployment, and declining living standards among the world’s poorest is to be avoided."
International economic policy coordination should be significantly strengthened in order to deal effectively with changes on such a scale.
Start with Europe.
It is by now patently obvious that austerity and domestic reforms are not enough to pull the eurozone’s periphery out of deep recession.
"Growing awareness of the failure of current policies is causing social discontent, civil disorder, and political instability, with the recently concluded Italian elections and the growing popular resistance to Greek reform efforts serving as a bellwether."
Returning the eurozone’s peripheral economies to the path of growth requires more than structural reforms and fiscal consolidation.
"It also requires a substantial reform of the monetary union’s system of economic governance, aimed at restoring financial stability and lowering borrowing costs, together with a boost in external demand in order to compensate for the effects of austerity."
"Reforming governance implies significant progress toward economic unification: centralizing European debt through Eurobonds, mobilizing sufficient rescue funds, allowing the European Central Bank to intervene in the primary bond markets, and establishing both a fiscal and a banking union."
"This is a tall order, in view of the reluctance of most EU member states to cede competences to European institutions."
But Europe should move more decisively in this direction.
"Otherwise, speculation on member states’ national debt will persist, keeping borrowing costs at levels that are inconsistent with the conditions required to sustain economic recovery."
"Concerning external demand, intra-European help in the form of reflationary policies in stronger economies is unlikely to prove sufficient, owing primarily to the fiscal and political conditions prevailing in Germany."
"Implementing a Marshall Plan-type initiative by mobilizing EU budget resources and additional lending by the European Investment Bank to finance investments in weaker countries could be an alternative, but it lacks political support."
"On a global scale, neither the US nor Japan is in a position to provide significant external stimulus."
"Only the emerging and developing economies of Asia could effectively contribute to lifting global demand through a coordinated effort aimed at boosting domestic consumption, which, in turn, would stimulate additional investment."
"Recent IMF experience suggests that, through appropriate coordination, private funds could be mobilized for big private-public partnership projects linking demand expansion with infrastructure investment."
"In other words, a global “New Deal” – combining policies designed to achieve an orderly realignment of consumption and investment worldwide – seems to be required."
The advanced economies should promote productivity-enhancing structural reforms with renewed vigor.
The eurozone should solidify its currency union.
And the emerging and developing economies should support domestic sources of growth.
"For such a deal to become possible, certain preconditions must be met."
"First, international policy coordination by the G-20 must be tightened by creating a permanent secretariat to make policy proposals and recommendations concerning macroeconomic and financial developments."
"The secretariat should actively cooperate with the IMF to benefit from its analysis, notably regarding exchange rates."
"Second, global financial reform must proceed at a faster pace."
"The financial sector requires tougher regulation, strengthened supervision, and internationally consistent resolution mechanisms to address the problems posed by very large, global institutions that are considered too big (or too complex) to fail."
Such reform is essential if the international financial system is to mediate the sizeable resource transfers that will underpin the required changes in the structure of global demand.
"Finally, a new trade pact – possibly, but not necessarily, within the Doha Round – is needed to ensure the major trading powers’ access to foreign markets."
"This is critically important for inspiring confidence in Asian countries, which might be persuaded to favor domestic, as opposed to external, sources of demand."
"Moreover, trade liberalization will also increase consumer confidence worldwide."
"The time is right for a new global settlement that targets growth, addresses crisis conditions in certain parts of the world, and rebalances the global economy to set it back on a path of strong and steady growth."
The Other Financial Crisi
"NEWPORT BEACH – Two variants of financial crisis continue to wreak havoc on Western economies, fueling joblessness and poverty: the one that we read about regularly in newspapers, involving governments around the world; and a less visible one at the level of small and medium-size businesses and households."
"Until both are addressed properly, the West will remain burdened by sluggish growth, persistently high unemployment, and excessive income and wealth inequality."
The sovereign-debt crisis is well known.
"In order to avert a likely depression, governments around the world engaged in fiscal and monetary stimulus in the midst of the global financial crisis."
"They succeeded in offsetting nasty economic dislocations caused by private-sector deleveraging, but at the cost of encumbering their fiscal balances and their central banks’ balance sheets."
"While sovereign credit quality has deteriorated virtually across the board, and will most probably continue to do so, the implications for individual countries vary."
"Some Western countries – such as Greece – had fragile government accounts from the outset and tipped quickly into persistent crisis mode. There they remain, still failing to provide citizens with a light at the end of what already has been a long tunnel."
"Other countries had been fiscally responsible, but were overwhelmed by the liabilities that they had assumed from others (for example, Ireland’s irresponsible banks sank their budget)."
"Still others, including the United States, faced no immediate threat but failed to make progress on longer-term issues.&nbsp;A few, like Germany, had built deep economic and financial resilience through years of fiscal discipline and structural reforms."
It is not surprising that policy approaches have also varied.
"Indeed, they have shared only one, albeit crucial (and disappointing) feature: the inability to rely on rapid growth as the “safest” way to deleverage an over-indebted economy."
Greece essentially defaulted on some obligations.
"Ireland opted for austerity and reforms, as has the United Kingdom."
The US is gradually transferring resources from creditors to debtors through financial repression. And Germany is slowly acquiescing to a prudent relative expansion in domestic demand.
"So much for the sovereign-debt crisis, which, given its national, regional, and global impact, has been particularly well covered."
"After all, sovereigns are called that because they have the power to impose taxes, regulations, and, at the extreme, confiscation."
"But the other credit crisis is equally consequential, and receives much less attention, even as it erodes societies’ integrity, productive capabilities, and ability to maintain living standards (particularly for the least fortunate)."
"I know of very few Western countries where small and medium-size companies, as well as middle-income households and those of more limited means, have not experienced a significant decline in their access to credit – not just new financing, but also the ability to roll over old credit lines and loans."
The immediate causes are well known.
"They range from subdued bank lending to unusually high risk aversion, and from discredited credit vehicles to the withdrawal of some institutions from credit intermediation altogether."
"Such credit constraints are one reason why unemployment rates continue to rise in so many countries – often from already alarming levels, such as 25% in Greece and Spain (where youth unemployment is above 50%) – and why unemployment remains unusually high in countries like the US (albeit it at a much lower level)."
"This is not just a matter of lost capabilities and rising poverty; persistently high unemployment also leads to social unrest, erosion of trust in political leaders and institutions, and the mounting risk of a lost generation."
"Indeed, unemployment data in many advanced countries are dominated by long-term joblessness (usually defined as six months or more)."
"Skill erosion becomes a problem for those with prior work experience, while unsuccessful first-time entrants into the labor force are not just unemployed, but risk becoming unemployable."
Governments are doing too little to address the private credit debacle.
"Arguably, they must first sort out the sovereign side of the crisis; but it is not clear that most officials even have a comprehensive plan."
Policy asymmetry is greatest for the countries most acutely affected by the sovereign-debt crisis.
"There, the private sector has essentially been left to fend for itself; and most households and companies are struggling, thus fueling continued economic implosion."
"Other countries appear to have adopted a “Field of Dreams” – also known as “build it and they will come” – approach to private credit markets, In the US, for example, artificially low interest rates for home mortgages, resulting from the Federal Reserve’s policy activism, are supposed to kick-start prudent financing."
The European Central Bank is taking a similarly indirect approach.
"In both places, other policymaking entities, with much better tools at their disposal, appear either unwilling or unable to play their part."
"As such, action by central banks will repeatedly fail to gain sufficient traction."
"In fact, only the UK is visibly opting for a more coordinated and direct way to counter the persistent shortfalls stemming from the private part of the credit crisis."
"There, the “Funding for Lending Scheme,” jointly designed by the Bank of England and the Treasury, seeks “to boost the incentive for banks and building societies to lend to UK households and non-financial companies,” while holding them accountable for proper behavior."
"The UK example is important; but, given the scope and scale of the challenges, the proposal is a relatively modest one."
"The program may stimulate some productive credit intermediation, but it will not make a significant dent in what will remain one of the major obstacles to robust economic recovery."
Proper access to credit for productive segments is an integral part of a well-functioning economy.
"Without it, growth falters, job creation is insufficient, and widening income and wealth inequality undermines the social fabric."
That is why any comprehensive approach to restoring the advanced countries’ economic and financial vibrancy must target the proper revival of private credit flows.
A Rest Stop for Europe
"PRINCETON – Last week, in a highly anticipated speech, German President Joachim Gauck cautioned against the blind pursuit of an “ever-closer” European Union, acknowledging that the growing inequality among member states is generating “a sense of unease, even unmistakable anger,” and increasing the risk of national humiliation."
"He pointed out that, in addition to the economic crisis, there is “a crisis of confidence in Europe as a political project.”"
"While Gauck made clear that he remains decidedly pro-Europe, he highlighted the need for closer reflection about Europe’s future – and especially that of the eurozone."
"Standing on the verge of greater integration, Europeans are hesitant, “unsure whether we should really stride out on the onward journey.”"
"Addressing this hesitation, he declared, will require a thoughtful, nuanced understanding of what “more Europe” actually means."
"Gauck may not have gone far enough: At this point, an ever-closer union may be a political mirage."
"Any meaningful progress toward stabilizing the eurozone would require a significant – potentially open-ended – financial commitment, and the EU is not politically ready to cross that threshold."
"Repeatedly pretending to move forward, then pulling back at the critical point, exacerbates political uncertainty and economic vulnerability."
"Rather than indecisively pursuing more unity, this may be the moment to restore effective sovereignty to national authorities in eurozone countries."
"Such a move would alleviate anxiety in the short term, thereby giving Europeans the opportunity to regroup in preparation for future steps toward a more integrated Europe and a more resilient euro."
"To this end, eurozone leaders must take three key steps."
"The dysfunctional system of European fiscal governance should be dismantled; fiscal responsibility should be returned to member states; and, to minimize the risk of excessive future lending, private lenders should be required to bear the losses implied by unsustainable sovereign debt."
The case against European fiscal governance is straightforward.
"Before the crisis, the single-minded emphasis on reducing national budget deficits to less than 3% of GDP led to extensive abuse."
"Either the target was openly flouted, as it was in leading economies like Germany and France, or the data were manipulated to obscure problems (a common practice throughout the eurozone, not just in Greece)."
And the belief in economic growth as a fiscal panacea led to unrealistically optimistic GDP forecasts.
"When the crisis struck, the 3% deficit target became the focal point for unrelenting austerity – a form of what anthropologist Clifford Geertz described as “involution,” which occurs when a process intensifies rather than changes in response to external or internal pressure."
"In other words, EU leaders began to complicate fiscal governance, ultimately creating an inefficient, inescapable labyrinth of regulation and bureaucracy."
"As fiscal metrics become increasingly intricate, monitoring efforts will become ever easier to undermine."
The case for returning fiscal responsibility to national authorities is also strong – and not only because centralized fiscal authority has proved to be so inefficient.
"With citizens of distressed countries bearing the fiscal burden of the crisis, the enduring presumption that they will not act responsibly is patronizing, at best."
And the current strategy of exchanging goodies for good behavior encourages game-playing and dilutes responsibility.
"While the risk that governments will succumb to fiscal temptation remains, citizens’ current suffering is likely to deter future excesses."
National fiscal sovereignty would facilitate the final crucial step: building a more mature relationship with private lenders.
"The eurozone was founded on the “no bailout” principle: if member states could not repay their debts, lenders would bear the losses."
"But lenders chose – correctly, as it turned out – to disregard that threat."
"Instead of enforcing the no-bailout principle and establishing a precedent, debtor countries used official loans to repay private creditors."
"As a result, these countries have condemned themselves to continued austerity, low growth, and high debt, while diminishing any future incentive for private lenders to impose fiscal discipline on sovereign borrowers."
Only by shifting the burden of responsibility back onto private lenders can debtor countries escape this quagmire.
"In the United States, each state is responsible for its fiscal management, without being forced to comply with a single, overarching template."
The states are not regulated by the federal government; they are disciplined by the knowledge that no one will repay their debts for them.
"And the system seems to work: entering the crisis, US states had significantly lower deficit and debt ratios than the eurozone’s vulnerable member states."
"So far, European integration has largely been a process of “falling forward,” with each stumble serving as a lesson from which a stronger union emerges."
"But, while this uncertain approach may suffice as a basis for declarations of good intentions, it does not inspire the confidence required for countries to make the profound financial commitment that is now needed."
Europeans should have the chance to regain their footing.
Transferring fiscal responsibility back to national authorities would not only mean the end of counterproductive efforts to manage fiscal affairs centrally; it would also diminish the sense of frustration and lack of control that is fueling Euro-skepticism.
"In short, taking a step back would provide an opportunity to reset, to reflect, and to plot the best course toward a more stable, more integrated Europe."
For a fiscal union to function – however unlikely that outcome may be – a solid foundation is crucial.
"As Gauck explained, Europeans “are pausing to… equip [themselves] both intellectually and emotionally for the next step, which will require [them] to enter uncharted territory.”"
Giving Europeans the time and space to choose more Europe would reinforce the core values upon which integration has rested for more than six decades.
"Continuing to stumble forward, however, would inevitably lead to a debilitating, if not fatal, fall."
Advise and Relent
"WASHINGTON, DC – Dropping bombs as a solution to the world’s trouble spots may be falling out of fashion (with the notable exception of Libya), but finger wagging is definitely back in."
"Hardly a day goes by without a major newspaper somewhere in the West offering sage and specific, but often not-so-friendly, advice to distant struggling democracies on what they “must” do to earn the “international community’s” approbation."
"Of course, such advice, like much of newspapers themselves nowadays, comes free of charge."
"But it is also advice that is free of responsibility, and, as Stanley Baldwin once said, power without responsibility is the prerogative of the harlot."
There is a considerable gap between offers of advice one cannot refuse and the responsibility to deal with the consequences when that advice proves wrong or extremely difficult to implement.
The world’s advice givers might try to keep this in mind when offering to help leaders of distant countries that are grappling with problems with which the adviser has little or no first-hand experience.
"Every once in a while, a profession (most frequently, economics) determines that it has reached a consensus on how to solve a problem."
The so-called “Washington Consensus” that held sway before the recent financial crisis was a good example.
"In the case of nascent democracies, the formula that is now often made compulsory is this: lift all bans on political activities, liberalize the media, hold elections (the sooner, the better), resolve all minority issues in favor of the minorities, abandon trade barriers, and rid the country of corruption, preferably overnight."
"New governments are urged to tackle all of these problems immediately and simultaneously, lest they lose “momentum” and begin backsliding."
The subtext is clear: be like us now.
"How to do this is left up to the new leaders, who are often credited with goodness and powers of persuasion they never had and never will have."
"In many cases, the cohesiveness of opposition movements that come to power in the wake of a political upheaval may not be what the international media presume it to be."
"Indeed, some components of these so-called “democratic coalitions” may not be democratic at all."
"Some leaders, such as Nelson Mandela, rise to the historic occasion, against all odds."
"Others, such as Kazakhstan’s Nursultan Nazarbayev (popular with Western media when he first came on the scene) plainly has not."
How can we help ensure these movements’ sustainability in such fluid moments?
Modesty is a virtue in private life.
It should also be a guide in dispensing political advice.
"I would start by keeping in mind that some countries’ capacity to absorb advice is limited, so it should be offered in smaller portions."
Where to start?
The most important and potentially sustaining feature of a new democracy lies in its effort to commit itself to observing international human-rights standards.
"In fact, there is a large body of literature that indicates that even countries in the aftermath of internal conflict can reach a higher level of compliance with these standards."
But human rights should not be conflated with democracy.
"While democracy is, no doubt, the form of governance that best preserves human rights, the two are not the same thing."
"Human rights will not co-exist with dictatorship, or with any other non-democracy, for long."
Setting standards and goals of human rights is a powerful signal that a country is pointing itself in the right direction.
The country is in effect announcing that it is moving toward democratic institutional arrangements.
"Banning torture, complying with international standards of prisoners’ rights, and enshrining rights of association and public assembly all immediately come to mind."
The embrace of essential human-rights standards as a cornerstone of a country’s development is one of our era’s seminal innovations.
The notion that a dictator can claim the sovereign right to abuse his people has become unacceptable.
A country that makes progress on human rights and commits to the change of behavior required to meet these international standards can also make a decisive turn toward a better future.
We should therefore focus on meeting international human-rights standards as a goal that a new democracy “must” (to use a favorite word of Western editorial writers) move toward quickly.
"But we should not confuse these values with the other essential elements of progress, such as establishing liberalized trade regimes, creating institutional structures with a separation of powers, and rooting out corruption."
"These are absolute necessities for democratic success, but they require longer-term development of institutional capacity."
"Corruption, for example, may have cultural antecedents and is part and parcel of institutional weakness."
"In most cases, neither can be remedied overnight."
"Above all, we need to show patience with the new governments of the countries we hope to see evolving toward democracy, and avoid the tendency to expect instant gratification."
A few months of politics will never overcome a few centuries of sociology.
"So, as we watch and wait, we need to be as supportive – but not overbearing – as possible."
A European Cure for Balkan Depression
VIENNA – European politics is mostly shaped by events and anniversaries.
"But while events are often unforeseeable, anniversaries are not."
"Five years from now, Europe will be reflecting on the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of World War 1, which led to a loss of life almost without parallel and set in motion a chain of events that led to the creation of Europe as we now know it."
World leaders may have already reserved some days in August 2014 to mark the occasion.
It is easy to predict that Sarajevo will be the place where they will meet to look back on Europe’s savage twentieth century.
But how will Sarajevo look in five years?
Will it still be the capital of a country whose citizens view the future bleakly and whose politicians have totally lost touch with the electorate?
Or is there a hope that European leaders will use the anniversary to announce the successful integration of the remaining Balkan countries into the European Union?
"A Balkan Monitor survey recently conducted by Gallup Europe gives suggests the state of public opinion in Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo 20 years on from the fall of the Berlin Wall and a decade after the end of the Kosovo war."
The findings seem to indicate that the next five years will be a make-or-break period for the region’s future development.
"While the overwhelming majority of citizens are convinced that further armed conflict in the region is unlikely, the public’s mood – with the exception of Kosovars and Albanians – is pessimistic."
The future promises peace without development.
Trust in political elites and in national and European institutions has been steadily declining.
"The majority of citizens have experienced a decline in living standards in the last year, and there remains a perception that people have more opportunities outside their own countries."
"Pessimism about employment is alarmingly high among young people, while corruption and government mismanagement are regarded as being widespread."
All those who have made it their job to praise the stability in the region should look at these figures.
"Indeed, it is striking that the majority of citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina believe that their leaders are not interested in their country joining the EU."
An absolute majority of citizens in each of the surveyed countries are convinced that their country is heading in the wrong direction.
Less than one in 10 Croats (whose country could be joining the EU in the near future) believes that their country is heading in the right direction.
There are now two options for the region: one is a “shock integration” program that takes all of the Western Balkan states into the EU; the other is a journey into the unknown.
The hope that these countries can muddle through on their own is a dangerous illusion.
Stability alone can no longer be the EU’s only objective in the region.
"The EU’s continuing presence as a colonial power in places like Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo could cause even more problems in the future, especially if benefits are not forthcoming."
"In particular, a delay in Serbia’s integration into the EU could bring Tito-inspired fantasies to the heart of the country’s foreign and security policy."
"Thus, demoralization of Balkan society creates a dynamic of its own when the best and the brightest see their future outside of their own countries and where “stability” is just another name for political and economic stagnation."
"If European leaders do plan to meet in 2014 in Sarajevo, they should act now."
"The ratification of the Lisbon Treaty allows for an element of visionary realism in European politics, as there are no longer any institutional obstacles to the future enlargement of the EU."
"Today, unlike a year ago, we know how many states are in the Balkans, and the"
But it is now or never for the Balkans.
"Visa liberalization can be a strategic step in the direction of “shock integration,” but if it is not followed by bold political action from the EU, it could merely become a re-packaging of the"
A European Opening for the Arab World
BERLIN – The people of Tunisia and Egypt have shown that democracy in Arab countries need not come at the barrel of a Western gun.
"But, while the drive for democratic change has been local and authentic, there is no guarantee of a successful political transition: democratically elected governments will have to address the same social and economic problems that contributed to the old regimes’ fall – not least the need to create jobs and opportunities for the young."
This will be impossible without external support.
"Given the myriad links between the European Union countries and the Mediterranean’s southern rim, Europe must not miss this opportunity."
"So far, the EU has offered to support democratization in Tunisia and Egypt by helping to organize free and fair elections, establish political parties, and reform the police, courts, and local administrations."
But such political-administrative support is not enough. Nor is a Marshall Plan-type program of grand investments sufficient.
"This is not to discount the need for such projects; the renewable-energy sector, in particular, holds enormous opportunities for cooperation."
"Europe needs clean energy, and will not be able to produce enough on its own territory."
The countries of North Africa also need energy – particularly more electricity and new networks to support urban and industrial development.
"Indeed, the availability of uninterrupted electricity often makes the difference between, say, a shoemaker’s workshop and a shoe factory."
And these countries have the most suitable environment for solar thermal power production.
"According to some optimistic studies, solar thermal power plants and wind farms in North Africa could not only boost economic growth there, but also provide more than 15% of Europe’s electricity by 2050."
"Obviously, cooperation agreements and private investment in this sector should be encouraged."
The problem is that such long-term investments bring results only in the medium and long term.
"They do not address today’s social or economic problems, nor do they signal a new society-oriented approach by Europe towards its Mediterranean neighbors."
"New EU programs should mainly aim at strengthening the specific capacities of Tunisia, Egypt, and others, and seek opportunities that benefit both sides of the Mediterranean."
"Catherine Ashton, the EU’s vice-president and high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, has proposed a Partnership for Democracy and Shared Prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean, which contains a host of useful measures, including facilitation of visas for students, academics, and business people."
"But, to make this scheme more concrete, I would suggest augmenting it with a “pact for labor and skills” between the EU and the Arab countries that choose a path to democratic transformation."
"Europe, while afraid of illegal migration, needs foreign labor for its own demographic reasons – not least young engineers, technical staff, doctors, and health-care workers."
"Tunisia, Egypt, and the other Southern Mediterranean countries have an abundance of young people with degrees and no jobs, who often also need to acquire practical skills."
This is most urgent for the Arab world’s baby boomers – those between 20 and 35.
The next generation is already smaller.
"As a practical step, the EU and its member states should offer 30,000 visas and work permits annually for graduates from participating Mediterranean countries."
"Such a program would include, first, a traineeship in European firms, followed by the opportunity to work in Europe for 5-8 years."
"At the end of that period, participants would receive soft business-startup loans from European development banks to create employment in their countries of origin."
"Designed for at least a 15-year period, such a program would be a strong signal in itself."
"It would show young people from Tunisia, Egypt, and other transformation countries that there are other options than getting on a boat to the Italian island of Lampedusa."
"It would be a real incentive to finish one’s university education (indeed, it should be augmented by investment in vocational schools, technical high-schools, and universities in North Africa and the Middle East)."
"Once implemented, the labor pact would help to change attitudes towards Arab immigrants in Europe – and Europe’s image in the Southern Mediterranean."
It would likely create lasting ties between people and economies.
"And it would address real needs in the Southern Mediterranean countries – improving professional skills, reducing the pressure on the local labor market, creating businesses and jobs – as well as in Europe."
Some warn against any programs for “temporary” or “circular” migration.
"To be sure, some who benefit would want to stay."
"But, while this “burden” might, in fact, benefit aging European countries, the risk is relatively low in the first place: Arab countries entering such a pact would be better governed than they were under the previous regimes."
"If they become consolidated democracies, as hoped, would-be entrepreneurs could stop worrying so much about official corruption."
And start-up loans from Europe would make it much easier to seek one’s fortune back home.
"Such an approach needs to be communicated both to the European public and to the people of Tunisia, Egypt, and other Arab countries."
It would reverse the pattern whereby Europe relies on repressive regimes to supply it with oil and gas and guard its borders against migrants.
"At long last, these countries’ demographic wealth would be used to meet their development needs."
Closing Europe’s Strategy Gap
MADRID – The ongoing crisis in Ukraine has been a hot topic of analysis for almost a year.
But one question has largely escaped thorough examination: what Russia’s annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine indicates about the European Union’s foreign policy.
"During the early stages of the crisis, Germany, which had bet heavily on Russia’s modernization, was averse to taking any consequential action."
"But, as the crisis deepened, German Chancellor Angela Merkel worked to persuade her European counterparts to implement a broad and biting sanctions regime."
"This certainly was a step in the right direction, but it did nothing to address the foreign-policy failings that helped spark the Ukrainian crisis and continue to undermine Europe’s response – namely, the EU’s misguided Neighborhood Policy (ENP) and its muddled approach to energy."
"On both of these fronts, the EU’s lack of strategic vision has created the impression that Europe is repeatedly being outmaneuvered by Russian President Vladimir Putin."
It increasingly appears that Ukraine is becoming locked in a “frozen conflict” – Russia’s foreign-policy specialty.
"Indeed, the situation in Ukraine represents a tactical victory for Russia, with the fragile but enduring ceasefire – and accompanying legislation that grants Donetsk and Luhansk considerable political autonomy – allowing Russia to entrench the conflict near the EU’s border."
"Moreover, the delayed implementation of key elements of the EU’s association agreement with Ukraine is clear evidence that, at the moment, Russia dictates the terms of EU-Ukrainian engagement."
"In Europe, the Kremlin has been able to pursue a successful divide-and-rule strategy, particularly in view of Hungary’s decision to suspend gas flows to Ukraine."
"Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s government, whose behavior in recent years has been at odds with the EU’s criteria for democracy, now openly approves of authoritarian regimes – and Putin’s, in particular – with serious potential consequences for European unity."
"Nonetheless, the timing of the current ceasefire, which coincides with the installation of a new EU Commission, is advantageous, as is Putin’s shortsighted emphasis on tactical victories."
EU leaders should take advantage of the break in the fighting to stop reacting and start anticipating.
"With a long-term strategic vision, the EU could overwhelm and ultimately undermine Putin’s short-term successes."
Such a vision must include a reconceptualization of the ENP.
"The program’s mission – to help guide the political, social, and economic transitions of neighboring states – is not inherently problematic; the problem lies in the way that the mission has been interpreted and pursued."
"For starters, the ENP assumes that all of the EU’s neighbors, both in the south and in the east, ultimately want to realize European values and structures in their own countries."
"In other words, the ENP does not account for the developmental, cultural, and aspirational differences among the EU’s partner countries."
The ENP suffers operationally from its excessively technical approach and lack of strategic vision.
"For example, before the Ukraine crisis, the European Commission was so focused on negotiating the technical features of the association agreement that it did not consider adequately the potential fallout of the process – such as, say, a response from Russia."
"To be sure, the EU recognized its need for a coherent strategy, and attempted to resolve it by establishing the European External Action Service and the position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs."
"But the EEAS ended up in a turf war with the European Commission, and outgoing High Representative Catherine Ashton did little to ease the tension, owing to her unwillingness to involve herself in intra-EU disagreements."
"It is telling that Ashton has made progress exclusively in areas defined by ample consensus, such as the negotiations on Iran’s nuclear program and the pact between Kosovo and Serbia."
Further eroding Europe’s effectiveness is its fragmented approach to securing energy supplies.
"With every country largely controlling its own energy policy, Europe’s energy market has become inefficient and excessively dependent on Russian supplies."
"To the extent that there has been an EU-wide energy strategy, it has related to renewables, rather than the intersection of geopolitics and energy security."
But there is reason for hope.
"The new Commission, which its president, Jean Claude Juncker, has restructured significantly, could provide Europe with the strategic leadership it so badly needs."
"In fact, Juncker has already expressed a desire to integrate incoming High Representative Federica Mogherini into the Commission’s policy program."
"The new structure – which tasks Mogherini with guiding and coordinating the work of multiple commissioners, including those responsible for trade, the ENP, and climate and energy – should strengthen the coherence and direction of EU policies, particularly after Mogherini completes her European Council-mandated assessment of the global strategic landscape."
But a restructured Commission is not enough to ensure a reset of Europe’s foreign-policy strategy.
"For that to happen, Mogherini must assert herself as a leader, backed by Juncker and the new European Council president, Donald Tusk."
"And, most important, all EU member states must recommit themselves to cooperation."
The Ukrainian people have demonstrated the power of Europe’s values.
"Indeed, Europe has a large set of tools at its disposal; it just needs to figure out how to use them."
"If it can, it will be better able to respond not only to the Russian challenge, but also to many of the other challenges that characterize today’s rapidly shifting global environment."
A Europe of Judge
"MAYNOOTH, IRELAND – As the Greek financial drama reaches its sorry dénouement, another crisis looms for the European project – this time in Germany, beginning with a case now before Germany’s Constitutional Court."
"Away from the rarefied atmosphere of EU summits (which, so far, have been shaping the Union’s response to events in Greece), other institutional actors have been – and are – shaping the EU system."
"In particular, courts have driven European integration forward as much as politicians have."
"The powerful European Court of Justice (ECJ), in particular, has frequently been criticized for using European law to disguise an integrationist agenda."
"Without the ECJ’s doctrines of “direct effect” and “primacy,” and without national courts that are willing to enforce these doctrines in their own jurisdictions, the EU most likely would not have attained the level of integration that it has."
"National courts may consider the effects of European integration on their constitutional and democratic institutions, affirming or rejecting the integration that has already taken place, or setting limits to supranational arrangements that might further impinge on national sovereignty."
"This is significant, because, in May 2010, a group of prominent German economists, led by Joachim Starbatty, commenced litigation before the German Constitutional Court in which they argued that the EU’s assistance to Greece and Europe’s new financial rescue fund violated Article 125, the EU treaty’s so-called “no bailout” clause."
The Court will begin hearing the case on July 5.
"Germany’s Constitutional Court has been among the most prominent in declaring what it considers to be the appropriate limits to EU integration, consistent with the country’s Basic Law (constitution)."
"In a number of landmark judgments, the Court has expressed skepticism about any move toward a federal EU."
"In 1993, when ruling on the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, the judges expressed clear reservations about the direction of the European integration process."
Their main argument was that the shortcomings of EU-level democratic practices required the German Bundestag to retain a substantial number of policy competences.
"For the same reason, the competence to decide upon the further allocation of competences had to remain a prerogative of the German state and could not be transferred to the EU."
"Crucially, the Court also asserted its authority to invalidate European laws if found by the judges to lack a basis in the European treaties."
"In another landmark ruling in June 2009, the Court made Germany’s ratification of the Lisbon Treaty conditional upon the passage of new legislation giving the Bundestag enhanced powers of scrutiny over European affairs."
The Court relied on the same constitutional doctrines and conceptions of sovereignty elaborated in its Maastricht judgment.
Now the court in Karlsruhe will have to determine whether the EU’s recently agreed European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is consistent with the Basic Law.
"The risk that the judges could rule the ESM illegal played no small part in efforts made in recent months by Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Nicolas Sarkozy to bind the EU to a revised and more intrusive economic governance framework, effected through an amendment to the existing treaties."
"The debate on sovereignty in Germany and other EU member states has been re-ignited not just by the debt crisis, but also by a string of controversial rulings by the ECJ, most notably the Court’s interpretation of the freedoms of establishment and service delivery articulated in its Viking, Laval, and Ruffert decisions."
The discontent within Germany with the cumulative impact of these decisions has been expressed publicly by some of the country’s most trusted public representatives.
"In September 2008, for example, former President Roman Herzog published a polemic entitled “Stop the ECJ!”"
He accused the Luxembourg judges of grabbing ever-greater competences at the expense of the member states and urged the Constitutional Court to invalidate several controversial ECJ rulings.
"Herzog’s broadside resonated across Europe, where for some time there has been considerable disquiet about “judicial activism” and what some see as an irreversible trend toward empowerment of the ECJ and other EU institutions."
"In many member states, the ECJ’s decisions have produced a backlash, especially on the left, with trade unions and social movements targeting the Court’s alleged zeal in siding with business over workers interests."
"Such arguments were deployed successfully during the 2005 referenda on the Constitutional Treaty in France and the Netherlands, and in Ireland during the referendum on the Lisbon Treaty."
"Indeed, the threat to the EU legal order does not lie solely with the German Constitutional Court."
"In Ireland, an embattled austerity-driven coalition government might well have no choice but to hold a referendum on the European Stability Mechanism."
It is almost certain that Euro-skeptic groups will ask the Irish Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of the ESM.
The Irish government has stated emphatically that any amendments to the Lisbon Treaty connected to eurozone reforms will not require a referendum.
"Its reasoning seems to be that the proposed changes fall far short of what the Supreme Court’s case law demands, and that the ESM does not alter the EU’s essential scope or objectives."
"If the Irish Supreme Court were to decide that the ESM requires popular consent, the EU would be faced with the prospect of yet another Irish referendum on Europe."
"Thus, Ireland might yet play as significant a part as Germany in determining the future of any amendments to the EU constitutional order, with each country’s top court playing as important a role as politicians in shaping Europe’s future."
"A Europe of Provinces, Not State"
"As the European Constitutional Convention assembles to debate the fine points of the European Union's future institutions, now is the moment to think the unthinkable about where Europe is heading."
"Or at least, to consider perhaps a quite different question: where would it be reasonable for the EU to move?"
Communism's fall saw the appearance of several small states in Europe.
"Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania reemerged from Soviet occupation."
Czechoslovakia split into two separate states.
"Yugoslavia gave way to Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia; it may perhaps shortly disgorge Kosovo and Montenegro as well."
"Although the Baltic republics merely reestablished their pre-WWII independence, and Yugoslavia's breakup was a bloody affair like so many other wars of independence, there is something tantalizing new in all this as well."
"In the interwar years, the Baltic states were often viewed as impractical, artificial creations of the Great Powers."
Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia came into existence because their constituent parts were not seen as viable independent states.
Why was this?
"Because 80 years ago, when Wilson, Clemenceau, and Lloyd George redrew the map of Europe, small states were dysfunctional in times of both war and peace."
"To be viable, a state needed to be large enough to defend itself and to constitute a relatively self-contained economic market."
None of this holds true today.
"With the prospect of entry into the EU, national markets matter less."
"Both EU and NATO membership make war among European member states unthinkable, and an attack on even the smallest NATO member would bring a response from all NATO members."
"Lacking such external threats, the ties between, say, Czechs and Slovaks (to say nothing of Serbs and Croats!) are too weak to warrant a common national level of government."
Does this tell us something about the future of Europe as a whole?
The difference between Czechoslovakia and Italy or Germany is mostly one of 50 years.
"After all, wasn't Italy, until 1860s, a collection of kingdoms and principalities?"
Wasn't Germany's unification a matter of ``blood and iron''?
"France and Spain are older, but is the marriage of Basques, Catalans, and Corsicans with their national states that much happier than the former Czech/Slovak marriage? Is there really that much reason why the Scots and Welsh should be part of the same national state as the English?"
"Abstract for a second from the idea of French or German or Italian identity, patriotism, the collective memories of war and carnage that cemented the consciousness of today's linguistic communities and think of this: why do Europeans need an intermediate level of government, between the common European framework and their local institutions?"
"Why do Piemontese, Bavarians, or Scots need intermediate national bureaucracies to run their tax policies, welfare programs, securities laws, and the largely useless, duplicative armies?"
"Wouldn't life be easier if a common market, currency, foreign policy, army, and a few other things were run on a Europe-wide basis, with the rest left to more meaningful local units?"
It is fashionable to mock the bureaucratic minutia of European regulation.
"But European regulation is as nothing compared to the mountains of national laws and decrees, billions wasted in political patronage, and the colossal state machines that eat up 30-40% of the economic product of Europe's nation states."
Could any common European state do worse?
"Indeed, the creation of a European federal government and the elimination of national intermediaries would probably lead to the greatest liberalization of the economy (and society as a whole) in Europe's entire history."
"Look at America in 1787: creation of the federal government swept away the balkanized system of pre-revolutionary colonies, ushering in an era of entrepreneurial expansion across the entire American Continent."
The simple fact is that Europe as a whole is too diverse to be captured by the economic and political interest groups that now dominate national states.
It is only as an
Nations also put Europe's constitutional balance out of kilter.
"Germany and Italy are simply too big, as compared to Portugal or Belgium (itself a rather questionable amalgam of the Flemish and the Walloons), and this creates the types of imbalances reminiscent of the heavy foot of Prussia in the old Bismarckian empire."
Could a federal Europe replace today's national identities?
Could the French and the British feel as spiritually at home in ``Europe'' as they feel in their national states?
"No, but must they?"
"When Europeans think of future institutions, the tension is always seen as that between national differences and the common European identity."
But what if common European institutions are not viewed through the prism of national institutions?
"What if the evolution of European consciousness proceeds not by an upward transfer of attachment to supranational institutions, but by a"
"Of course, the demise of national states is not imminent, but not because they are so deeply rooted in the consciousness of their citizens."
"Indeed, national identities are mostly impoverishing abstractions, clichés, like race, class, and other ideological creations."
Think of how much more genuine diversity would there be in a united Europe if national states did not squat in the middle.
But Europe's nation states are not going to disappear for a while because they are
A Europe of Women?
PARIS – Are women in Europe on the verge of becoming an engine for political change?
"In economic-development circles, experience and common sense suggest that progress, accountability, and hard work start with and depend on women."
"Micro-credits, for example, are much more efficient when women receive and repay them."
"Perhaps because they bear children and must find the means to feed them, women are now perceived as the best and most determined “agents of change.”"
That seems to be as true now of European politics as it has been of economics in parts of Africa and Asia.
"The results of Italy’s recent municipal elections could be a signal of an incipient electoral dynamic: it was women who voted Silvio Berlusconi’s party out of power in Milan, a city that he has long controlled (and the original seat of his power)."
"No direct link exists between that result and the dramatic Dominique Strauss-Kahn scandal in New York, but in the immediate aftermath of DSK’s arrest, Italian women and young voters decisively mobilized to defeat Berlusconi’s party (led in Milan, ironically, by a woman)."
These voters could no longer stand the combination of machismo and vulgarity that had once served so well the man Italian humorists now call “Berlus-Kahn.”
"When Berlusconi first came to power 17 years ago, he had the support of a majority of women."
"They were not discouraged by his ambivalent perception of them (by turns celebrating their traditional domesticity and glorifying their sexual objectification). But Italian society has changed: most women are now working, and they are no longer willing to accept Belusconi’s anachronistic and outrageous chauvinism."
"Italian men may pity the aging, isolated leader, who looks increasingly like his wax effigy at Madame Tussaud’s. But Italian women (indeed, women everywhere, it seems) feel only anger and humiliation over a man so obsessed with himself, his various criminal trials, and his vulgar pleasures that he appears to them to have no purpose left except to remain in power as long as possible."
"Women, of course, are not alone in their opposition to Berlusconi, but they made the difference in Milan."
"They are the incarnation of modernity, animated by a yearning for simple dignity and respect."
They are not alone in the vanguard of a new Europe of women.
"As Iceland spiraled into bankruptcy, owing the irresponsible behavior of its mostly male political and financial elites, the people of Iceland decided that only a strong and responsible woman could redress the country’s problems. So they elected one as President."
"The depth and gravity of the current economic and social crisis in countries like Greece, Portugal, and Spain present women with a new opportunity."
"Confronted with what many of them perceive as the equivalent of an “economic war,” women are playing an increasingly important role in maintaining their families’ financial security. And the more widespread this becomes, the more women will seek a political role that reflects their economic clout."
"Of course, women’s changing status may not translate immediately into growing political influence. And the rest of Europe might never follow the example of Scandinavia, where gender equality has advanced much further than anywhere else."
"Similarly, regardless of the outcome of DSK’s trial in New York, the case might represent a turning point in the treatment of women in Europe."
"Public and private displays of atavistic machismo, one hopes, will no longer be considered acceptable."
"In the Arab world, too, from Tunis to Cairo, young women have played an important role in the revolutionary process."
"Their appetite for change – understandable, given the treatment of women in traditional Muslim societies – appears to be one of the main causes underlying the force of the revolutionary impulse in Tunisia and Egypt."
None of this is to argue that “women” are a universal force for positive change in Europe and around the world.
"Consider, for example, Marine Le Pen, the new head of France’s National Front, Elena Ceaucescu, the sordid wife of the former Romanian dictator, or, more recently, Tunisian ex-President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali’s wife, Leila Trabelsi, who fled to Dubai with 1.5 tons of gold plundered from the central bank."
"The point, simply, is that with so many people in so many countries demanding far-reaching change, the politics of gender is very much in play – in Europe and beyond."
The main question is whether the growing number of women in politics will deliver the different perspectives and modes of leadership that many voters (or protesters) now seem to crave.
A Euro Sabbatical
"MUNICH – Under substantial external pressure, the eurozone’s crisis-hit countries are, at long last, bringing themselves to make painful cuts in their government budgets. Salaries are being slashed and public employees sacked to reduce new borrowing to a tolerable level."
"And yet, competitiveness in Greece and Portugal, in particular, is not improving."
The latest Eurostat figures on the evolution of the price index for self-produced goods (GDP deflator) show no tendency whatsoever in the crisis-stricken countries towards real devaluation.
"But real devaluation, achieved by lowering prices vis-à-vis their eurozone competitors, is the only way to re-establish these countries’ competitiveness."
A reduction in unit labor costs can also increase competitiveness only to the extent that it actually results in price reductions.
"After all, it was price inflation in the crisis countries, fueled by massive inflows of cheap credit following the introduction of the euro, that resulted in their loss of competitiveness, ballooning current-account deficits, and accumulation of enormous foreign debt."
"Now that capital markets are no longer willing to finance these deficits, prices should be going into reverse, but this, obviously, is not happening."
"In 2010, inflation in some of the crisis countries lagged slightly behind that of their eurozone competitors."
"The latest Eurostat figures for the third quarter of 2011, however, are already showing a different picture: the price level in Portugal and Greece has remained practically unchanged over the course of the year, and in Italy and Spain it even rose slightly (by 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively)."
Only Ireland continued on a path of rapid deflation – as it has since the country’s real-estate bubble burst in 2006 – with a relative price decrease of 2.2%.
"On the whole, Ireland has become cheaper relative to its eurozone competitors by a total of 15% over the course of the past five years."
"This internal devaluation is paying off: while Ireland was still running a current-account deficit of 5.6% of GDP in 2008, the European Commission expects the outturn for 2011 to have been a 0.7%-of-GDP current-account surplus."
"True, much of this is mere debt-service relief, given that Ireland was able to repay its foreign liabilities with self-printed money, for which it pays only 1% interest."
"However, Ireland’s big trade surplus did improve further."
"Ireland owes much of this turnaround to its efficient export sector, whose supporters were able to enforce a political U-turn."
"Greece, on the other hand, is under the influence of a strong import lobby."
"As the Greek economics minister, Michalis Chrysochoidis, has said, this is attributable to European Union subsidies, which drove entrepreneurs to follow the easy money into the import sector."
"Now these importers form a powerful bulwark against any policy that causes deflation, even though lowering prices – and thereby redirecting Greek demand from foreign to domestic products and helping tourism – is the only way to put the Greek economy back on its feet."
"Since Greece’s current-account deficit as a share of GDP was three times higher than Ireland’s, Greek prices would have to fall by about half to achieve the same kind of success."
"It is inconceivable that Greece could manage that within the eurozone without widespread social unrest, if not conditions approaching those of civil war."
But it isn’t just importers who are blocking real devaluation.
"Unions, too, are resisting the necessary wage reductions, and public and private debtors fear the prospect of insolvency if their assets and revenues are assessed at a lower value, while their debts remain unchanged."
The situation is intractable.
Many people regard debt relief and socialization of debts as the only way out.
"This help has been given. The recent agreement gave Greece relief of €237 billion ($316 billion), about 30% more than Greece’s net national income of roughly €180 billion euros.But such help only entrenches the wrong prices – and thus the economy’s lack of competitiveness."
"The debts will re-emerge like a tumor, growing year by year, while undermining the creditworthiness of stable eurozone countries."
"If that happened, the euro would eventually collapse."
Only a price reduction would create current-account surpluses and enable the crisis countries to pay off their foreign debts.
It is time for Europe to come to terms with this remorseless truth.
Those crisis countries that do not want to take it upon themselves to lower their prices should be given the opportunity to leave the eurozone temporarily in order to devalue prices and debts.
"In other words, they should take a kind of euro sabbatical – a proposal that has now also been taken up by American economist Kenneth Rogoff."
"After the ensuing financial thunderstorm died down, the sun would come out again very quickly."
"The creditor countries would have to shoulder big losses from write-downs, but they would still end up with more than they would have gotten had the crisis countries remained within the eurozone, because these countries’ new prosperity, gained by leaving, offers the only chance of recovering any assets at all."
A Failed Global Recovery
NEW HAVEN – The global economy is in the midst of its second growth scare in less than two years.
Get used to it.
"In a post-crisis world, these are the footprints of a failed recovery."
The reason is simple.
The typical business cycle has a natural cushioning mechanism that wards off unexpected blows.
"The deeper the downturn, the more powerful the snapback, and the greater the cumulative forces of self-sustaining revival."
Vigorous V-shaped rebounds have a built-in resilience that allows them to shrug off shocks relatively easily.
But a post-crisis recovery is a very different animal.
"As Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff have shown in their book This Time is Different, over the long sweep of history, post-crisis recoveries in output and employment tend to be decidedly subpar."
"Such weak recoveries, by definition, lack the cushion of V-shaped rebounds. Consequently, external shocks quickly expose their vulnerability."
If the shocks are sharp enough – and if they hit a weakened global economy that is approaching its “stall speed” of around 3% annual growth – the relapse could turn into the dreaded double-dip recession.
That is the risk today.
There can be no mistaking the decidedly subpar character of the current global recovery.
"Superficially, the numbers look strong: world GDP rebounded by 5.1% in 2010, and is expected to rise another 4.3% in 2011, according to the International Monetary Fund."
"But because these gains follow the massive contraction that occurred during the Great Recession of 2008-2009, they are a far cry from the trajectory of a classic V-shaped recovery."
"Indeed, if the IMF’s latest forecast proves correct, global GDP at the end of 2012 will still be about 2.2 percentage points below the level that would have been reached had the world remained on its longer-term 3.7% annual-growth path."
"Even if the global economy holds at a 4.3% cruise speed – a big “if,” in my view – it will remain below its trend-line potential for over eight years in a row, through 2015."
"This protracted “global output gap” underscores the absence of a cushion in today’s world economy, as well as its heightened sensitivity to shocks."
And there have certainly been numerous such blows in recent months – from Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis and Japan’s natural disasters to sharply higher oil prices and another setback in the US housing recovery.
"While none of these shocks appears to have been severe enough to have derailed the current global recovery, the combined effect is worrisome, especially in a still-weakened post-crisis world."
Most pundits dismiss the possibility of a double-dip recession.
"Labeling the current slowdown a temporary “soft patch,” they pin their optimism on the inevitable rebound that follows any shock."
"For example, a boost is expected from Japan’s reconstruction and supply-chain resumption."
Another assist may come from America’s recent move to tap its strategic petroleum reserves in an effort to push oil prices lower.
But in the aftermath of the worst crisis and recession of modern times – when shocks can push an already weakened global economy to its tipping point a lot faster than would be the case under a stronger growth scenario – the escape velocity of self-sustaining recovery is much harder to achieve.
The soft patch may be closer to a quagmire.
"This conclusion should not be lost on high-flying emerging-market economies, especially in Asia – currently the world’s fastest-growing region and the leader of what many now call a two-speed world."
"Yet with exports still close to a record 45% of pan-regional GDP, Asia can hardly afford to take external shocks lightly – especially if they hit an already weakened baseline growth trajectory in the post-crisis developed world."
The recent slowdown in Chinese industrial activity underscores this very risk.
Policymakers are ill prepared to cope with a steady stream of growth scares.
They continue to favor strategies that are better suited to combating crisis than to promoting post-crisis healing.
That is certainly true of the United States.
"While the US Federal Reserve Board’s first round of quantitative easing was effective in ending a wrenching crisis, the second round has done little to sustain meaningful recovery in the labor market and the real economy."
"America’s zombie consumers need to repair their damaged balance sheets, and US workers need to align new skills with new jobs."
Open-ended liquidity injections accomplish neither.
European authorities are caught up in a similar mindset.
"Mistaking a solvency problem for a liquidity shortfall, Europe has become hooked on the drip feed of bailouts."
"However, this works only if countries like Greece grow their way out of a debt trap or abrogate their deeply entrenched social contracts."
The odds on either are exceedingly poor.
The likelihood of recurring growth scares for the next several years implies little hope for new and creative approaches to post-crisis monetary and fiscal policies.
"Driven by short-term electoral horizons, policymakers repeatedly seek a quick fix – another bailout or one more liquidity injection."
"Yet, in the aftermath of a balance-sheet recession in the US, and in the midst of a debt trap in Europe, that approach is doomed to failure."
Liquidity injections and bailouts serve only one purpose – to buy time.
"Yet time is not the answer for economies desperately in need of the structural repairs of fiscal consolidation, private-sector deleveraging, labor-market reforms, or improved competitiveness."
Nor does time cushion anemic post-crisis recoveries from the inevitable next shock.
"It’s hard to know when the next shock will hit, or what form it will take; otherwise, it wouldn’t be a shock."
"But, as night follows day, such a disruption is inevitable."
"With policymakers reluctant to focus on the imperatives of structural healing, the result will be yet another growth scare – or worse."
A failed recovery underscores the risks of an increasingly treacherous endgame in today’s post-crisis world.
A Fair Deal for Africa’s Resource
WINDHOEK – Namibia is a resource-based economy that has embarked on an ambitious development program.
"Our vision is to turn Namibia into a knowledge-based, diversified economy by 2030."
"One of the major principles upon which this vision is based is the idea of “partnerships” – a major prerequisite for the achievement of dynamic, efficient, and sustainable development."
Partnerships between governments and foreign investors are at the core of the sound management of natural resources.
But such partnerships can’t be taken for granted on a continent where the quest for natural resources has fueled decades of violent conflict.
"Genuine partnership is difficult to achieve when resource-rich countries view foreign mining and drilling companies only as adversaries, seeking unfair and inequitable contracting agreements."
"From the perspective of companies, partnership is unattractive when they are forced to incur large losses owing to project disruptions and contract renegotiations."
"By contrast, partnerships are strengthened if companies and governments recognize their shared interest in durable, mutually beneficial contracts that ensure stable revenue streams from projects."
"This requires a framework that takes into account, among other things, developmental possibilities, environmental concerns, labor conditions, and community interests, and that is adaptable to changing circumstances."
"For governments, contracts are more likely to be durable if they are negotiated in a way that enables countries to receive fair and predictable long-term revenues."
"For developing countries, this source of income can be substantial over several decades, and is needed by governments for investment in infrastructure, health care, education, etc."
"On the other hand, poorly conceived and negotiated contracts not only prevent countries from enjoying the full long-term benefits of their natural resources, but also help to entrench poverty, corruption, and even conflict, particularly when governance systems are inadequate."
"For companies, contracts are more likely to be durable if they are negotiated in a way that continuously rewards firms for risky and capital-intensive investment in terms of the net present value of their earnings."
"Companies also want, of course, contracts that won’t be repudiated by the next government."
"Indeed, poorly negotiated contracts are a recipe for adverse business outcomes, such as reduced security of mining titles, increased likelihood of operational disruptions from targeted civil protests, and greater risk of revisions to tax and other conditions."
"Many governments in Africa simply don’t have the capacity to negotiate complex contracts that require a wide range of in-depth knowledge of law, finance, geology, economic modeling, etc., while firms typically do."
"As a result, the contracts that are negotiated often do not meet the criteria described above – to the disadvantage not only of governments, but also of firms interested in durable contracts."
"In the absence of conditions for equitable negotiations, governments often deem the resulting contracts unfair – thus dooming them to be breached at some point."
"In these circumstances, there is an urgent need for a facility that allows governments of poor countries to negotiate on a par with foreign investors to reach contracts that are as fair as possible under the given circumstances."
"The outcome of such negotiations can be expected to be – and to be perceived to be – more balanced, more transparent, more stable, and therefore more sustainable."
The time has come to establish such a facility – in the interest of a mutually beneficial partnership between governments and foreign investors.
A Fair Deal for Turkey
"Turkey has been given what looks like an ultimatum from the EU Commission: open your ports for ships from Cyprus within a month, or you may risk a halt to the EU accession talks now underway."
"At the same time, the Commission’s latest report on Turkey’s progress toward accession notes that political reforms have slowed down, further calling into question the country’s future EU membership."
"The Commission’s progress report will be dealt with by the European Council next month. At that meeting, European leaders should ask themselves the following questions: Has the EU given Turkey a fair deal in the case of Cyprus?"
Has the EU’s behavior been consistent in supporting political reform in Turkey?
What are the EU’s long-term interests vis-à-vis Turkey?
If the answers to the first two questions are “no” – as I believe they are – the third question becomes vitally important.
"True, Turkey has closed its ports to ships from (Greek) Cyprus, and this is a violation of agreements. But it is also true that the northern Turkish part of Cyprus is denied access to free trade and other benefits from EU-membership."
This is because Cyprus remains a divided island.
It was assumed that Cyprus should be united when the country joined the EU in 2004.
A United Nations plan for unification was accepted by the Turkish part.
But the Greek Cypriots voted against the plan because their leaders did not live up to the implicit deal with the EU to support it.
"Nevertheless, Cyprus became an EU member – but only the Greek part."
"This was clearly a mistake, because it made the EU part of the conflict. It gave Greek Cypriot leaders the possibility of blocking progress in negotiations between the EU and Turkey."
So how can Turkey under these conditions maintain confidence in the EU’s fairness?
"Political and legal reforms in Turkey in recent years have been remarkably far-reaching, for they have clearly been spurred by Turks’ wish to move closer to the EU."
But Turkish public support for EU membership has fallen dramatically as Turks have grown to feel that they are not being given a fair deal.
"This has given new strength to those who want Turkey to develop in another direction, towards a more Islamic society instead of a modern secular state."
"Therefore, the recent lack of progress in Turkey’s reform process can to a large extent be explained by the EU’s behavior."
This leaves us with the third question: what kind of Turkey does the EU want?
There should be no doubt about the answer: it is clearly in the EU’s interest to see Turkey’s democracy and economy continue to strengthen.
"More than 40 years ago, it was promised that once Turkey lives up to the preconditions for membership, it will be welcome in the EU."
It is high time that European leaders take this promise seriously.
It is a sad fact that a large majority of voters in the EU are against Turkish membership.
But they are reacting to the current situation.
"When they are asked if they would like a reformed Turkey as a partner – a Turkey that lives up fully to the conditions for membership described in the Copenhagen Criteria (democracy, rule of law, respect for human rights, and an effective market economy) – many more are inclined to say yes."
European leaders must therefore take up two challenges.
"First, they should say clearly to their own voters that the EU must live up to its promises to Turkey, and that this is in the larger interest of all Europeans."
"Second, they should give Turkey a fair deal in the negotiations."
The first litmus test on European leadership concerns the practical problem of access to harbors.
"Here the Finns, who chair the EU right now, have taken an initiative to implement a pragmatic solution that takes into consideration both sides in the conflict."
The Finnish initiative should be given strong support from all European leaders.
"At the same time, a new effort should be made to bring life to the UN’s proposals regarding Cyprus."
"If this means putting pressure on some actors within the EU’s own ranks, so be it."
A Fair Deal on Climate Change
The agreement on climate change reached at Heiligendamm by the G8 leaders merely sets the stage for the real debate to come: how will we divide up the diminishing capacity of the atmosphere to absorb our greenhouse gases?
The G8 leaders agreed to seek “substantial” cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and to give “serious consideration” to the goal of halving such emissions by 2050 – an outcome hailed as a triumph by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
"Yet the agreement commits no one to any specific targets, least of all the United States, whose president, George W. Bush, will no longer be in office in 2009, when the tough decisions have to be made."
One could reasonably ask why anyone thinks such a vague agreement is any kind of advance at all.
"At the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, 189 countries, including the US, China, India, and all the European nations, signed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, thereby agreeing to stabilize greenhouse gases “at a low enough level to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.”"
"Fifteen years later, no country has done that."
"US per capita greenhouse gas emissions, already the highest of any major nation when Bush took office, have continued to rise."
"In March, a leaked Bush administration report showed that US emissions were expected to rise almost as fast over the next decade as they did during the previous decade."
Now we have yet another agreement to do what these same nations said they would do 15 years ago.
That’s a triumph?
"If Bush or his successor wants to ensure that the next round of talks fails, that will be easy enough."
"In justifying his refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol, Bush has always referred to the fact that it did not commit China and India to mandatory emission limits."
"Now, in response to suggestions by Bush and other G8 leaders that the larger developing nations must be part of the solution to climate change, Ma Kai, the head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission, has said that China will not commit to any quantified emissions reduction targets."
"Likewise, the spokesman of India’s foreign minister, Navtej Sarna, has said that his country would reject such mandatory restrictions."
Are China and India being unreasonable?
Their leaders have consistently pointed out that our current problems are the result of the gases emitted by the industrialized nations over the past century.
"That is true: most of those gases are still in the atmosphere, and without them the problem would not be nearly as urgent as it now is."
"China and India claim the right to proceed with industrialization and development as the developed nations did, unhampered by limits on their greenhouse gas emissions."
"China, India, and other developing nations, have a point – or rather, three points."
"First, if we apply the principle “You broke it, you fix it,” then the developed nations have to take responsibility for our “broken” atmosphere, which can no longer absorb more greenhouse gases without the world’s climate changing."
"Second, even if we wipe the slate clean and forget about who caused the problem, it remains true that the typical US resident is responsible for about six times more greenhouse gas emissions than the typical Chinese, and as much as 18 times more than the average Indian."
"Third, the richer nations are better able than less well-off nations to absorb the costs of fixing the problem without causing serious harm to their populations."
"But it is also true that if China and India continue to increase their output of greenhouse gases, they will eventually undo all the good that would be achieved by deep emissions cuts in the industrialized nations."
"This year or next, China will overtake the US as the world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter – on a national, rather than a per capita basis, of course."
"In 25 years, according to Fatih Birol, chief economist at the International Energy Agency, China’s emissions could be double those of the US, Europe, and Japan combined."
But there is a solution that is both fair and practical:
"Establish the total amount of greenhouse gases that we can allow to be emitted without causing the earth’s average temperature to rise more than two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), the point beyond which climate change could become extremely dangerous."
"Divide that total by the world’s population, thus calculating what each person’s share of the total is."
"Allocate to each country a greenhouse gas emissions quota equal to the country’s population, multiplied by the per person share."
"Finally, allow countries that need a higher quota to buy it from those that emit less than their quota."
The fairness of giving every person on earth an equal share of the atmosphere’s capacity to absorb our greenhouse gas emissions is difficult to deny.
Why should anyone have a greater entitlement than others to use the earth’s atmosphere?
"But, in addition to being fair, this scheme also has practical benefits."
"It would give developing nations a strong incentive to accept mandatory quotas, because if they can keep their per capita emissions low, they will have excess emissions rights to sell to the industrialized nations."
"The rich countries will benefit, too, because they will be able to choose their preferred mix of reducing emissions and buying up emissions rights from developing nations."
A Farewell to (Glorious) War
"In recent days, Italy’s government fell after losing a parliamentary vote on the country’s troop deployment in Afghanistan, while Britain and Denmark announced that they are to begin withdrawing their troops from Iraq."
"Whereas the Bush administration is deploying an additional 21,000 American soldiers in Iraq, and is pushing for more allied troops in Afghanistan, America’s allies are rejecting its Middle East policy."
"They are increasingly convinced that “victory” will be elusive in any asymmetric conflict between states, however powerful, and religiously driven armed insurgents."
Donald Rumsfeld’s dogma of military “transformation” – the technological upgrading of an army’s capacity to enable decisive victory with fewer troops – failed resoundingly in Iraq.
"Nor could Israel, with its overwhelming technological advantage, defeat Hezbollah in Lebanon."
More rockets and missiles fell on northern Israel in 33 days than hit Britain during all of World War II.
"So the Israelis now must reckon with an entirely new phenomenon: an asymmetric entity, Hezbollah, with nation-state firepower."
So the fierce debate over whether to increase the size of American ground forces in Iraq is beside the point.
Neither the Soviet experience in Afghanistan in the 1980’s nor NATO’s today vindicates the claim that troop numbers are what matter most on the modern battlefield.
"When geo-strategic military front lines are non-existent, as in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq, mass no longer equals victory."
The great military thinker Carl von Clausewitz’s notion of “decisive battles” as the “center of gravity” of war is simply irrelevant to conflicts that have no visible “center of gravity.”
"Indeed, while wars from the time of Hannibal’s defeat of the Romans in 216 B.C. to the Gulf War of 1991 had this center of gravity, with a massive concentration of force capable of bringing an enemy to its knees, such industrial inter-state wars have now become an historical anachronism."
"Most states nowadays lie within borders that are widely accepted as legitimate, and they increasingly abide by international norms of behavior in times of war."
"In fact, the obligation of states to abide by humanitarian rules of conduct while their enemies are free to barbarize warfare is what makes asymmetric wars especially insoluble."
"Moreover, in an era of global media and international war crimes courts, the criteria for states’ use of military force have become more complex than ever."
"Inter-state combat may still occur where strategic front lines can be found, such as Israel’s border with Syria, India’s border with Pakistan, and the border dividing the two Koreas."
"In such cases, war, as the Egyptians showed in 1973, might still serve as an avenue to resolving a conflict."
The Syrians might be tempted to launch an offensive against Israel with the objective of breaking the deadlock over the future of the Golan Heights.
"However, in the case of Kashmir, the asymmetric conflict currently fought by proxies and terrorist groups might not degenerate into all-out war precisely because India and Pakistan have mutual nuclear deterrence."
This changing nature of the battlefield essentially means that war as a conclusive event in an international conflict has become obsolete.
The facile Clausewitzian wisdom that military action ultimately leads to a political solution is no longer convincing.
"“Victory” cannot bring peace, simply because there will always be a war after the war."
"Thus, for example, the conventional war in Kosovo lasted for two months, only to usher in a six-year asymmetric conflict."
"Likewise, America’s three-week “shock and awe” campaign in Iraq in 2003 ended in “victory,” but opened the gates of hell for occupiers and ordinary Iraqis alike."
"And six months after the merciless pounding of southern Lebanon, Hezbollah is as strong as it was before."
Nor does the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan six years after their overthrow now seen too far-fetched.
"It is during the war after the war that the occupier’s inferiority is revealed, with constant reinforcements increasing the number of targets for the insurgents far more quickly than the occupier can adapt to the changing battlefield."
"The insurgents in Iraq, as the British admit, were able in just three years to cope with their enemies’ technological superiority in a way that the IRA in Northern Ireland was unable to do in 30 years."
"The Iraq war and Israel’s wars with Hamas and Hezbollah show the limits of what military power can achieve, as well as vindicate diplomacy and conflict resolution."
"When it comes to tackling complex political and cultural conflicts, forging international and regional alliances around a legitimate objective is more important than sheer military capacity."
"That said, it would be dangerously naïve to believe that the exercise of power and the capacity to intimidate are unnecessary."
"But the objectives of the use of force need to be linked to the recognition that in today’s asymmetric conflicts, victory is no longer achieved on the battlefield."
Only better-informed foreign policies that can address the genuine anxieties of civilizations in crisis will yield more sustainable results.
Afghanistan and the Future of NATO
Things aren’t going well in Afghanistan.
"Sometime at the turn of 2001/2002, the Bush administration concluded that the stabilization and reconstruction of Afghanistan was no longer its top priority and decided to bet instead on military-led regime change in Iraq."
Afghanistan can thus rightly be seen as the first victim of the administration’s misguided strategy.
But the Bush administration is not the sole culprit for the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan.
"It was NATO’s job to ensure the country’s stability and security, and thus NATO’s weak General Secretary and the European allies, especially Germany and France, share the responsibility for the worsening situation."
"Yet, despite all the difficulties, the situation in Afghanistan, unlike that in Iraq, is not hopeless."
"There was a good reason for going to war in Afghanistan in the first place, because the attacks of September 11, 2001, originated there."
"Once undertaken, the West’s intervention ended an almost uninterrupted civil war, and is still viewed with approval by a majority of the population."
"Finally, unlike in Iraq, the intervention did not fundamentally rupture the inner structure of the Afghan state or threaten its very cohesion."
"If the West pursues realistic aims, and does so with perseverance, its main objective – a stable central government that can drive back the Taliban, hold the country together and, with the help of the international community, ensure the country’s development – is still achievable."
There are four preconditions of the West’s success:
"establishment of Afghan security forces strong enough to drive back the Taliban, limit drug cultivation, and create domestic stability; willingness on the part of NATO to remain militarily engaged without any national reservations – with Germany and France in particular giving up the special conditions of their involvement; a significant increase in development aid, especially for the so far neglected Southern part of the country; renewal of the regional consensus reached in Bonn in 2001, under which the reconstruction of the Afghan state was to be supported by all the parties concerned."
"The war in Afghanistan was never just an Afghan civil war; rather, for decades the country has been a stage of regional conflicts and hegemonic struggles."
"So, while the rebirth of the Taliban is in part due to the woefully neglected reconstruction of the Pashto Southern and Eastern part of the country, it also has external causes."
"Most notably, for more than two years now, Pakistan has been moving away from the Bonn consensus, betting on the rebirth of the Taliban and giving it massive support."
"Indeed, without Taliban sanctuaries on the Pakistani side of the Afghan border, and without Pakistani financial backing, the rebirth of the Taliban’s armed insurgency against the central Afghan government would have been impossible."
"Pakistan’s actions are explained mainly by its strategic readjustment in light of US weakness in Iraq and the region as a whole, and by the newly strengthened relationships between India and Afghanistan, resulting in an increased Indian presence in Central Asia."
"In this connection, Pakistan views the Karzai government in Kabul as unfriendly to Islamabad and a threat to its key strategic interests."
"Without Taliban sanctuaries on the Pakistani side of the Afghan border and the backing by the Pakistani intelligence service ISI, the rebirth of the Taliban’s armed insurgency against the central Afghan government would have been impossible."
"But, by aiding the Taliban, Pakistan is playing with fire, because there are now also Pakistani Talibans who pose a threat to Pakistan."
US policy toward Pakistan is also dangerously shortsighted and reminiscent of the mistakes the US made in Iran prior to the 1979 Islamic revolution.
"Nevertheless, the US at least has a Pakistan policy – which is more than can be said about NATO and Europe."
"In fact, it is all but incomprehensible that while the future of NATO is being decided in the Hindu Kush mountains, and while thousands of European soldiers stationed there are risking their lives, Pakistan – the key to the success or failure of the mission in Afghanistan – is not given any role in NATO’s plans and calculations."
"Part of NATO’s trouble stems from the fact that a number of member states insist on the right to make their own military and political decisions, and these “national reservations” severely limit NATO’s ability to act."
"If NATO is to succeed, this must change without further delay."
"A NATO summit, during which all members would take stock of the situation and draw the appropriate conclusions, is therefore long overdue."
"The national reservations must be go, and a joint strategy for success must be adopted, including a massive increase in civilian and military aid for Afghanistan, if the country is to be prevented from descending into the same abyss as Iraq."
"Moreover, a regional consensus among all the players must be rebuilt, including Pakistan, Iran, and India, whose joint responsibility for peace, stability, and redevelopment in Afghanistan must be recognized by Europe and the US."
"To accomplish this, a follow-up conference to the Bonn Agreement is also required."
"While the war in Iraq has been based on wishful thinking, the war in Afghanistan was necessary and unavoidable because it was there that the terrorist threat of September 11, 2001, originated."
"It would be more than a tragedy – it would be unparalleled political folly – if, because of a lack of commitment and political foresight, the West were to squander its successes in Afghanistan."
"Europe would have to pay an unacceptably high price, and NATO’s future would likely be jeopardized."
No Exit from Afghanistan
"NEW DELHI – Despite frequent turmoil and repeated invasions, Afghanistan has remained virtually unchanged for centuries."
"Nearly 120 years ago, Winston Churchill described the futility of warfare in the region: “Financially it is ruinous."
Morally it is wicked.
"Militarily it is an open question, and politically it is a blunder.”"
"Churchill’s assessment undoubtedly rings true for many United States and NATO officials today, as they attempt to coordinate an exit from America’s longest overseas combat commitment in history."
"While the war in Afghanistan may have resulted in fewer American deaths and injuries than previous US wars, the human cost remains substantial – especially after factoring in Afghan deaths and injuries."
"Moreover, trillions of dollars have been wasted, with the few positive effects of the US-led military intervention already beginning to fade, and its many adverse consequences continuing to destabilize the region."
US President Barack Obama is now trying to negotiate a new “status of forces” agreement with the Afghan government in order to establish how many US troops will remain in Afghanistan and the terms of their deployment.
"But the reality is that the US is scuttling from a conflict that it has lost, just as it did in Vietnam almost 40 years ago, leaving the beleaguered population to its own devices."
"Rather than admit defeat, US officials are resorting to diversionary rhetoric."
"For example, speaking recently in New Delhi, Secretary of State John Kerry said that the key to stabilizing Afghanistan is to build a “new silk road” connecting it with central Asia – a cynical contrivance apparently aimed at cloaking America’s failure in illusions of future commerce."
"Kerry’s insistence that the US is not withdrawing, but “drawing down,” is a similarly transparent attempt at manipulation."
"To be sure, America’s presence in Afghanistan has spawned important regional linkages; unfortunately, they are not the kind that support economic renewal."
"The last decade of war and lawlessness has facilitated the Taliban’s proliferation across Pakistan and Afghanistan, leading the Taliban to consider itself an indefatigable force – a belief that could lead its leaders to undercut any progress toward stability."
"In fact, the Taliban’s confidence already drove them to disrupt plans for peace talks with the Afghan government."
"After agreeing to establish an office in Qatar exclusively to host the talks, in June the Taliban opened a quasi-embassy of the “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.”"
"The Afghan government responded by suspending talks with the Taliban, as well as the status-of-forces negotiations with the US."
"Pakistan recommends seeking an alternate venue for the negotiations with the Taliban, rather than abandoning reconciliation efforts altogether."
"This bodes well for the resumption of talks, given that Pakistan played a leading role in facilitating the Taliban’s emergence and is now home to the Afghan Taliban’s ruling council, including its leader, Mullah Omar, along with the Pakistani Taliban."
"India’s former ambassador to Afghanistan, Vivek Katju, is confident that Afghan President Hamid Karzai’s anger at the Taliban’s gambit in Qatar will not delay negotiations for long."
"(Indeed, Karzai has reportedly already met with Taliban representatives for secret talks aimed at restarting the stalled peace initiative.)"
"Katju attributes the talks’ inevitable resumption to America’s “strategic desperation,” which is so acute that the US would be unlikely even to follow through on Kerry’s pledge to call off the talks if any link to Al Qaeda were found."
"After all, the US has already accepted the Taliban’s unrealistic assurances that it will not use Afghanistan as a base from which to “foment trouble” – that is, execute terrorist attacks – elsewhere."
"Fortunately for the US, the Taliban is no longer a homogeneous group."
A decade of running and hiding from unrelenting surveillance and targeted drone attacks has caused the movement to splinter.
"Yet, as the security expert Sajjan M. Gohel has observed, “the displaced and disillusioned Taliban youth of today” have “found solace and purpose in an extremely radical interpretation of Islam.”"
"The Taliban may no longer be a unified force, but they clearly remain a dangerous one."
All of these developments have put India in a difficult position.
"In Afghanistan, America’s military was so tactically dependent on Pakistan that, on several occasions, the US encouraged India to curtail development projects, such as rebuilding Afghanistan’s infrastructure."
"Following America’s military withdrawal, Afghanistan will most likely revert to pre-war conditions; Pakistan will revive state-sponsored terrorism against India; and extremism will spill into the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir."
"In order to make the best of a grim situation, India must be prepared to protect its own interests at all costs."
"After all, as the US extricates itself from its Afghan quagmire, its own national interests will continue to trump all other considerations."
"But China, Pakistan, and Iran also have their own important national-security interests in Afghanistan that each will now do their utmost to guarantee."
"So, while US troops may be leaving Afghanistan, an end to the violence spawned by America’s war remains nothing more than a distant dream – especially for Afghanistan’s South Asian neighbors."
Afghanistan’s Customary Anguish
"FARAH , AFGHANISTAN – When the problems riddling Afghan society are listed – violence, insecurity, corruption, religious fundamentalism – one dominating factor is usually left out: the influence of customary law."
"In Afghanistan, there are three principal legal references: constitutional law, the Koran, and the system of customary law known as Farhang , the most dominant and strictest version of which is called Pashtunwali (the way of the Pashtuns)."
"Originally an ancient honor code, Farhang ensures the dominance of the oldest male of any household, followed by married sons, unmarried sons, and grandsons, then wives (with the youngest at the bottom)."
"Collective decisions are taken by patriarchs in councils called jirgas , where all have to be in agreement."
"This agreement includes including collaborating or not with the Taliban, cooperating with the Coalition forces, accepting or refusing poppy eradication in a village."
"Everything else is left to patriarchal discretion. Here, no one will intervene except to reinforce the application of   the patriarch's rights – say, in stoning a supposedly wayward girl, or turning a blind eye to so-called “honor killings” of women."
"Every act of an Afghan male’s life is integrated in a form of reciprocity, in which nothing is free."
"Melmastia , the basic tenet of hospitality means “I will give you shelter if you ask me to, even if you are a fugitive murderer; but, in exchange, you fight my battles.”"
This sense of customary obligation is why so many of President Hamid Karzai’s cronies remain in place and Taliban leaders remain safe.
"Women are excluded from collective decision-making, as they are mere objects."
Girls are literally sold upon marriage (the father is paid money for his daughter’s labor and reproductive capacity) and join their husband’s household.
"The younger the girl, the higher the price."
"Marriage, especially in the provinces, is routinely consummated on pre-pubescent bodies."
Yet women are precious in their own way.
"A family’s principal “cultural capital” is its honor, which is ensured by denying women any opportunity to highlight male failings and therefore tarnish clan respectability."
"As a result, women must be strictly secluded and made invisible when in public, for they are personally responsible for the desire that they could ignite in schools, hospitals, parks, or markets."
The all-covering burqa ensures sufficient anonymity to permit women a certain amount of freedom in public space.
"Every female simultaneously carries her father’s and her husband’s honor, and will stoically submit to all forms of violence committed in its name."
"This may mean dying in childbirth rather than risking the “dishonor” of giving birth in a public place, a hospital, in front of strangers."
"Going to court is practically unheard of, as it would mean renouncing family practices."
"From the male point of view, resorting to outside police or judicial intervention would signify an inability to fight one’s own battles – an admission of defeat and a symbolic castration."
"This helps explain the intense corruption present in Afghan courts, where “honor” can be redeemed by bribing a judge to have a rapist or murderer released."
"As violence is strictly a private matter, relinquishing justice to state institutions could be an unacceptable humiliation."
Customary law is not rigid in that it is made to fit round the demands of global economy.
It has become more rigorous in it s applications due to the influence of
"For example, while the Koran allows for a measure of female inheritance, tribal custom does not authorize it, which explains the popularity of tribal councils to resolve inheritance problems and cheat women out of their rights."
"Similarly, whereas the Koran requires four eyewitnesses as proof of adultery, mere suspicion of some unregulated, potentially sexual conduct by a woman warrants stoning under customary law."
"Yet an awareness of alternatives is seeping in through the media, even in remote provinces."
"Iranian films and the much loved Indian TV serials, not to mention the occasional American film, influence peoples' expectations."
Add to that the experience of having lived abroad as refugees in Pakistan and Iran.
Girls know that there are options to an unacceptable way of life: women are increasingly demanding more from life than what custom ordains.
"This is especially true for those who have lived in Iran, a totally Muslim environment that allows women the freedom to study and work as well as access to adequate healthcare and family planning."
"Once back in rural Afghanistan, forced into brutal marriages, many desperate women – especially returnees from Iran – resort to self-immolation."
"Violence and murder of women are on the increase, perpetrated by men who feel that these alternatives pose a threat to their authority."
The West imagines that religion is the central issue in Afghanistan.
"But the heart of the matter is the preservation of ancient patriarchal rights that go back to Biblical times, reformatted to fit the demands of globalized capitalism."
Governments and international aid organizations have failed to take into consideration the role of
Afghanistan’s Drug-Friendly Environment
"Afghanistan’s President Hamid Karzai has stepped up international fundraising efforts in recent weeks, seeking a fresh package of military and reconstruction aid from the United States, together with stronger strategic guarantees. But Karzai’s relationship with his sponsors has begun to sour, in part owing to charges that his government has failed to stop the resurgence of Afghanistan’s huge opium trade."
"Underlying the opium trade issue is a security threat of another kind, one overlooked since the US-led invasion toppled the Taliban regime in 2001, despite the grave risk it poses to Afghanistan’s long-term stability, and that of the region."
"In countries like Afghanistan, where 80% of the population lives on what they grow and many communities live far from any water source, environmental damage can be both economically devastating and politically momentous."
"That lesson should have been absorbed and understood, not least by American strategists, long before the Taliban’s fall."
"After all, desertification and deforestation helped fuel the rise, two decades earlier, of the Maoist guerilla group Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) in Peru."
"Sendero, which supplemented its income with drug production and timber smuggling, deliberately chose drought-weakened and deforested mountain villages as the stronghold of its insurgency."
"Similarly, the Maoist insurgency in Nepal, which has claimed 10,000 lives, exploits the desperation of mountain villagers hit by flash floods – the result of deforestation higher up."
"No Maoist group could ever gain a toehold in Afghanistan’s parched Pashtun south (these were, after all, people who, bare-knuckled, smashed the Soviets). But the Taliban’s rapid rise in the 1990’s was inextricably linked to the failure of irrigation systems."
Villagers whose crops shriveled and whose livestock died in a prolonged drought saw joining the Taliban as an economic opportunity.
"Had there been more irrigation, the Taliban’s gains might have been far less impressive."
"The Taliban are now an increasingly spent force, but lack of water reinforced the logic of opium production across its former strongholds in the south."
"Irrigation has failed or is inadequate in Helmand, Uruzgan, and Kandahar – three of the top five opium-producing provinces – where indebted farmers are hooked by the economics: opium brings in eight times as much cash as wheat and uses less water."
"Without serious investment in irrigation, including construction of reservoirs to make use of the snowfall in the Hindu Kush, and in new cash crops such as saffron and rose oil, Afghanistan’s drift toward narco-statehood will continue, with all the instability that this implies."
Clear-cutting of old growth forests in the mountains bordering Pakistan may prove as problematic.
"Agriculture there has been damaged by the cutting of walnut, apricot, and mulberry trees for winter fuel, and by a failure to replant poplar, willow, and tamarisk – the trees that hold fragile meadows in place."
"These sorts of trees can be restored, given a concerted campaign and investment in nurseries to produce local varieties."
"Loss of the ancient cedar, pine, fir, and oak forests on the slopes above is another matter."
This year’s snowmelt caused landslides and flooding – a warning of more soil erosion and destruction of arable land to come; hundreds died and thousands lost their livelihoods.
Forestry has always been a problem in Afghanistan.
"In 1960, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization spoke of wasteful logging practices, such as “head-skidding” (in which a log is rolled downhill, ripping up plants and soil)."
"Aerial photographers were called in, and a large budget was set aside. But, in 1976, the FAO admitted in a new plan that forest and watershed management activities had “turned out to be quite limited.”"
"The 1976 plan called for sustainable logging and basic forest-fire control, but war intervened, costing Afghanistan half its forest cover."
"Up to 60% of the old growth forest in Nangahar, the second largest opium-producing province, may have been cut during the war years."
"Mujahedin factions and later the Taliban exported stands of fine-grained cedar by the truckload from Nangahar and surrounding provinces to Pakistan, often in return for arms."
"Illegal logging continues today, with only ineffectual efforts made to stop it."
"At the current rate, Afghanistan’s old growth forest could vanish within a decade."
The UN acknowledges the problem but is (rightly) unwilling to risk sending forestry experts into a tribal region where American and allied troops venture only in armored convoys.
Safety concerns and cost also limit intervention by international conservation organizations.
"They are armed and work with the backing of drug and emerald smugglers – and often of local officials. The price of plank cedar in Lahore is incentive enough to corrupt, or kill, any Green Corps men brave enough to stand in their way."
Environmental issues are of paramount importance in marginal countries because their impact on human survival is immediate and direct.
"The inadequate response to pressing questions of natural resource management, whether of water or trees, merely strengthens the hands of opium dealers and malcontents in what is already the most disaffected and sensitive part of Afghanistan – the clear-cut mountain slopes where intelligence officers believe Osama bin Laden is most likely holed up."
Afghanistan’s Dying Mother
"Roughly 75% of Afghan newborns that die do so because of lack of food, warmth, and care."
Unloved little girls fare the worst.
"In Afghanistan as a whole, a woman dies of pregnancy-related causes every 27 minutes – and perhaps even more frequently, because many such deaths go unrecorded."
"Many, perhaps most, are under sixteen years of age."
"The Taliban – blamed nowadays for just about all of Afghanistan’s ills – have officially been gone for nearly seven years, so why are conditions still so abysmal?"
"In Kabul and Herat, mobile phones abound, a tooth-eroding concoction called “Afghan Cola” is sold, the Internet works (sometimes), there are ATM machines, sophisticated heroin laboratories, four-wheel drive vehicles, five-star hotels, ads for private banks – all the trappings of globalized modernity."
"Yet so many women die like flies, in pools of blood and deep-rooted indifference."
"While billions of dollars in aid have led to improvements in urban areas, where health facilities have been built and midwives trained, the overall maternal death figures have hardly changed."
As one doctor told me: “A competent midwife or nurse would rather be out of work in Kabul than stuck in a remote village.”
But most Afghans live in remote villages – those in Badakhshan can be reached only after a day’s bumpy ride on a donkey.
"This miserable situation has been attributed to various causes, mainly lack of infrastructure and local economic conditions."
"But cultural questions must also be addressed, because gender discrimination is the most important cause of maternal mortality."
"In Afghan society, discrimination begins at birth."
"One obvious reason is that a boy is destined to support his parents and much of his family all his life, and therefore represents a long-term investment, whereas a girl will be given over to her husband’s family as soon as possible."
Feeding a girl is seen as effectively looking after someone else’s property.
"Once, I heard a dreadful story of a breech birth which a traditional midwife did not know how to handle."
"In the end, she wrenched the baby’s body out, severing it from its head, which remained inside the mother’s womb."
It took six days to get the woman to a hospital in Jalalabad though it was not very far from where she lived.
"She somehow survived, with major health complications, including permanent fistula, which will condemn her to a life of exclusion from her family and unrelieved misery."
"That tragedy can be read on many levels, each more heart-rending than the next."
But note that it occurred near a health facility.
"As soon as the midwife saw that the baby was coming out feet forward, she must have known that there was little she could do to save either mother or baby."
"Even before that, she would have noticed that the child had not turned properly, and that major problems were on the way."
"This means that someone – a husband or mother-in-law – had taken the decision not to send the young woman to the hospital, instead keeping her in inhuman suffering for nearly a week."
"The solution is not just to build more hospitals, but also to change deep-rooted disdain for women."
"And, sadly, things have become worse in the past 30 years, as Afghanistan’s particular brand of Islam, combined with its legacy of dire poverty and war, compounds an already misogynist pre-Islamic tradition."
Maternal mortality is a sinister consequence of this complex situation.
"The legal system, schools, and the media could bring change, but no official entity takes the problem seriously enough to initiate effective action."
"The central reason is despairingly simple: women’s lives are not valued, and even women themselves perceive their suffering as being unavoidable."
"What Afghanistan needs is an inquest after each death and laws making it a criminal offense to forbid access to medical aid, when available, to women and children (or, more correctly, to children and their children, given that girls are often married by age 14)."
"Prisons, I fear, would be full of abusive husbands and, I regret to say, vengeful mothers-in-law."
"Health education through public media, reaching distant areas of the country, is an urgent priority, but has been utterly ignored in favor of commercial priorities."
"Questioning culture is, of course, a politically incorrect approach."
"But we must refuse to bow before the altar of tolerance when it comes to what is truly unacceptable, wherever it occurs, and this is what the world is witnessing passively in Afghanistan."
Does diversity authorize such brutal deaths and senseless violence against women simply because some supposedly traditional practice allows them to be married before their bodies are ready and denies them health care when they give birth?
The fight against maternal mortality in Afghanistan must become a global priority.
"Ultimately, a society that allows women to be brutalized will remain a breeding ground of generalized violence."
Afghanistan’s Feminist Revolution
"On April 16, more than 300 Afghani women – many of them students – marched together in Kabul in protest of a new law passed by Parliament that would impose a series of Taliban-like restrictions on women. The law would permit marital rape, limit women’s movements – say, for work or study – without male permission, and even make it illegal for a woman to refuse to dress as her husband wishes."
"The women, facing a crowd of furious men calling them “whores” and other epithets, marched two miles under a rain of abuse and delivered their petition against the law to legislators."
"Both houses of Parliament had approved the law, and President Hamid Karzai signed it."
"The law now affects only the Shia minority, but threatens to affect pending legislation that could restrict the rights of non-Shia women as well."
"When Western media sought quotes from the women, they frequently heard a Western-style feminist refrain: “These laws would make women into a kind of property.”"
"In the West, the counterpoint to the notion of woman as property has been a highly individualistic demand for personal autonomy – decision-making based primarily on a woman’s own wishes, rather than as wife, mother, community member, or worshipper."
"But, while some Western feminist insights may be useful to Afghani women and other women in the developing world as they resist certain forms of male oppression, we should not assume – as Western feminists often have – that our job is to proselytize “our” feminism."
"On the contrary, the feminism expressed by women such as these Afghani heroines should educate us in the West about our own shortcomings."
The core theory with which emerging feminists in more traditional and religious societies are working is far different from that of Western feminism – and in some ways far more profound and humane.
"In India, for example, feminists articulated to me a vision of women’s equality that was family-centered rather than self-centered, and that valued service to community rather than personal gratification."
"They did not see their struggle as a cultural or ideological clash between men and women, but rather as a very practical effort to live free from violence and sexual assault, forced child marriage and bride-burning, and legal exclusion from parity."
"The emerging consensus in India in support of greater rights and freedoms for women, while certainly causing some upheaval and adjustment (especially within the growing middle classes) has not yet – and might never – poison the basic trust and warmth between men and women."
"Nor does it seem likely to emulate the splintered, individualized, solitary society – and the commodified sexual revolution – that Western, self-based feminism reflects."
"This version of feminism – the notion that women can claim equality and still have a valued role in the home, prize family above all, and view rights in the context of community and spirituality – seems like a much-needed corrective to some of Western feminism’s shortcomings."
"Ideally, men’s drive for progress in the developing world would also evolve, uniting the idea of the autonomous self with support for family, community, and other ties, and Western men would learn from this as well."
"Moreover, intellectually, these women remind us that Western feminism did not have to evolve the way it did, and can still change and grow to embrace a more satisfying and humane definition of equality."
"Simone de Beauvoir, whose seminal book"
"The good news for all women, East and West, is that President Karzai, under intense international criticism – and not just Western criticism – changed the law less than one week after the march."
This global uproar is a testament to how three decades of Western feminist challenges to leadership have changed the world for the better.
But our (Western) moment of feminist leadership is over now – for good reasons.
"We know by now what our problems are as women in the West, and we know the blueprint for solving them."
"What we lack now is not analysis, but the organizational and political will to do so."
So the leadership role is shifting to women in the developing world.
"Their agenda is more pressing, and their problems, frankly, far more serious than ours, which makes it much more urgent for them to develop theories appropriate to the challenges they face."
"If one of those courageous Afghan women who marched in Kabul wrote – as I hope she or one of her sisters in the developing world is doing right now – the seminal text for the next 50 years on non-Western feminism, it would no doubt be equality-driven and practical."
"And perhaps, in its likely view of the world as being more than the sum of consuming, competing autonomies, or gender warfare, it would be a valuable challenge to truisms that we Western feminists – and the men who love us – have thought we had to take for granted."
Afghanistan’s Terrorized Women
"KABUL – Recently, the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) office in Kudoz province reported the rescue of a young woman who had been imprisoned in her in-laws’ dungeon for seven months."
Fifteen-year-old Sahar Gul was forced to marry an older man who serves in the Afghan army.
"She was then kept in the dungeon by her husband’s family and brutally tortured for months, because she refused to work as a prostitute."
"Over the past ten years, the AIHRC has received more than 19,000 complaints related to violence against women."
"Despite making some progress in investigating the complaints and referring them to the justice system, as well as in raising public awareness about the issue, the challenges remain huge."
"Since 2002, many efforts have been made to improve women’s lives in Afghanistan."
"The country has enacted several new laws and established a fairly advanced legal framework to end discrimination against women, including a new law that criminalizes any act that results in violence against women."
But laws and policies alone are not sufficient to protect women from horrific domestic abuse.
"Indeed, the Gul case is hardly the only well-publicized case."
"There was also Gulnaz, a young woman who was jailed for adultery after being raped by a relative (she was recently released after a presidential pardon, but may be forced to marry her attacker)."
"The husband of another young woman, Aisha, cut off her nose and ears when she ran away."
Violence against women in Afghanistan persists for many reasons.
"First, the country has inherited a patriarchal tribal tradition that assumes women’s inferiority."
Women are therefore deprived of their basic rights and freedoms.
"Second, there is a strong political incentive to deprive women of their rights."
Radical groups receive immense support from the large share of the population that opposes women’s rights.
"The Taliban, for example, have consistently used an anti-women policy to appeal to tribal and rural people."
"Third, family pride and honor are deemed more important than a woman’s individual well-being and safety."
"For example, if family members beat or abuse a woman, she has few options."
"Often, her only choice is to remain silent or risk disgracing the family."
"If she does report the matter to the authorities, the case will almost certainly never be properly investigated, nor the perpetrators ever prosecuted."
"Gul, for example, complained to the police about her abusive in-laws, but she was returned to the family when some of their influential contacts intervened."
"Fourth, laws are often arbitrarily applied, and sharia (Islamic law) frequently takes precedence over civil legislation, resulting in widespread impunity for crimes of violence against women."
"For example, in October 2010, the Afghan Supreme Court ruled that women who run away from home can be charged with prostitution, unless they go to the police or an immediate relative's home.&#160;It is this mindset that led to Gul’s victimization."
"Finally, while the Taliban lost power ten years ago, discrimination and violence against women has occurred in Afghan society for centuries."
"Thus, despite some progress, public and official sensitivity to violence against women is only slowly emerging."
The Afghan government must take several steps to protect women fully.
"Above all, perpetrators of violence against women should be prosecuted and tried under due process of law. This will require strengthening the rule of law and ending the prevailing culture of impunity."
"That, in turn, requires educating the public further about human rights and women’s rights through school textbooks, continuing education courses, and a vigorous media campaign. It also requires persuading representatives and policymakers to develop policies and allocate budget revenues to combat violence against women, and training police and judges to handle cases of violence against women without deferring to claims of family honor."
"Perhaps most importantly, non-constitutional justice systems, such as sharia, must be monitored and checked, if not prohibited altogether."
"As for Sahar Gul, her case must be thoroughly investigated, and the police and judiciary must commit to bringing her torturers to justice."
"Furthermore, Gul’s case, and others like it, should be studied in order to understand the roots of such crimes."
"Until Afghanistan’s leaders begin to address this problem seriously, our country will continue to bear the scar of violence against women on its face."
A Field Guide to Israeli Hawk
"Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's announcement that he plans to dismantle Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip, as well as some settlements in the West Bank, has shocked and caught people off guard both in Israel and around the world."
Many denounced Sharon's plan as a trick.
But that surprise was wrong-headed from the start.
"Despite the way it often looks to outsiders, debates in Israel about the future of the occupied territories have never been confined to hawks and doves."
"Like everything in Israel, the process is more complicated, especially where the hawks are concerned."
"Basically, there are two species of Israeli hawks: call one kind ideological and the other strategic."
"Ideological hawks view the occupied territories as an integral part of the historical Land of Israel, the homeland of the Jewish people."
"For them, the territories are part of the Jewish patrimony, which is why they insist on referring to the West Bank by its Hebrew historical appellation - Judea and Samaria."
"Not all ideological hawks are religious, although those who are base their claim on divine promises and prophecies."
"But many ideological hawks are secular nationalists, and their jargon is similar to that of typical Central and Eastern European nationalists."
Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir belonged to that category.
Ideological hawks usually come from the National-Religious Party and from members of the Likud.
"They are inspired by the nationalist ideology connected with Vladimir Jabotinsky, who founded ""Revisionist"" Zionism as a challenge to the more moderate version espoused by Israel's Founding Fathers like Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion."
Then there are the strategic hawks.
"For them, given Israel's narrow and vulnerable geographic shape and continuing Arab enmity, controlling the West Bank and Gaza is not an ideological imperative, but is driven by security considerations."
"For them, Jewish settlements in the territories are not a return to historical lands, but security outposts, aimed at preventing - or repelling from a better strategic position - an attack on the Israeli heartland."
"They may be right or wrong in this assessment, but it is not an ideological one."
"Ariel Sharon, who comes from a military background - he grew up in a social milieu much nearer to Labor than to Jabotinsky's ideas - is a strategic hawk."
"For ideological hawks, compromises are treason: how can you jeopardize the historical patrimony of the Jewish people, let alone God's promise to Abraham?"
"Strategic hawks, however, are open to practical bargains and compromises - if the circumstances are right and if the security considerations justify it in their eyes."
It is in this context that Sharon's moves should be seen.
He was elected on the promise that he would bring peace and security.
He has brought neither.
"With the defeat and demise of Saddam Hussein, the danger of an ""Eastern front"" against Israel has diminished."
"Absent a Palestinian partner, and given continuing Palestinian terrorism - which Israel's harsh responses fail to quell - what Sharon appears to be doing now follows from his strategic-oriented thinking: set up an effective barrier, move some of the isolated and strategically untenable settlements, and wait for another day."
"If one follows Sharon's statements in the last year, a clear pattern emerges."
"First, he admitted that ""eventually"" a Palestinian state would emerge - something unthinkable for dyed-in-the-wool ideological hawks."
"A few months later, he scandalized his own Likud party conference by stating that occupation is wrong and untenable - another shock for those who always speak of ""liberated"" rather than ""occupied"" territories."
"Last December, he explicitly stated that Israel is headed towards unilateral disengagement, and that this would entail the ""relocation"" of some settlements."
"Although this was still merely verbiage, it was novel language for a Likud prime minister."
"Sharon's latest statements, though, explicitly specified the settlements to be evacuated; the Director of the National Security Council, General Giora Eiland, was appointed to chair an inter-ministerial Relocation Committee and work out plans for conducting the evacuations, including compensation for relocated settlers."
All of this has radically altered Israel's domestic political map.
Some ideological hawks in Sharon's government threatened to resign;
Shimon Peres announced that Labor will offer Sharon a parliamentary safety net; there is even talk about Labor joining a national unity government.
"The test, of course, is not in the planning, but in the implementation of withdrawal, and the road is long and bumpy."
Sharon's timing may have been determined by his problems with police investigations into alleged corruption.
"Yet anyone who would like to predict Sharon's future behavior should remember that unlike Begin and Shamir, Sharon comes from the military, and for him security - not ideology - is supreme."
So his apparent pragmatism should come as no surprise.
A Flat World and a Round Ball
"With the final stage of the World Cup approaching, now is a good opportunity for a mid-tournament appraisal."
"This year’s Cup, unlike the previous one in Japan and South Korea in 2002, didn’t witness any real upsets in the first round."
"Switzerland and Australia surprisingly reached the elimination round, and the Asian and African teams disappointed somewhat, with only Ghana advancing."
"There have been just two ugly matches so far, full of fouls, nasty attacks, and unnecessary aggression, as well as numerous yellow and red cards: Italy vs. the US, and Portugal vs. the Netherlands."
"Otherwise, we’re experiencing a wonderful Cup in Germany, in terms of both sportsmanship and the overall atmosphere."
"As for Germany and the Germans, one hardly recognizes one’s own country and people."
Even Mother Nature has played along.
"After a long winter and a non-existent spring, summer started promptly with the first kick-off – and virtually overnight, Germany has flaunted its sunniest and most delightful side."
"The weather is Mediterranean, and all of a sudden, so are the people."
"The Cup’s organization has been exceptional (as was to be expected), with excellent police work giving hooligans hardly a chance."
The whole of Germany has been celebrating a never-ending party with guests from all over the world (which was not expected).
And the German team has put on a wonderful display of heart warming and modern offensive soccer (which nobody could have expected!).
"More importantly, not only in the German team, but also in the country as a whole, a young, cool, laid-back, and carefree Germany is raising its head – a Germany that is cosmopolitan, friendly, and good-humored."
Years of bad news appear to have passed the Germans by without a trace.
"Doctors are on strike, taxes are on the rise, the parties in government are mauling each other, and Chancellor Angela Merkel herself proclaimed in a prominent speech that the country is in disastrous shape."
"But the Germans, undaunted by it all, simply keep celebrating one great soccer party with their newfound friends from all over the world."
"The black, red, and gold German tricolor adorns the entire country as never before, but almost nowhere are there nationalist undertones."
"In fact, the flags of many nations fly alongside German."
"In Berlin, as in other large German cities, taxis sport the flags of their drivers’ home countries – from Angola to Saudi Arabia."
"Fans don not just their nations’ flags, but also fantastic costumes evocative of their home countries’ colors."
"Flags are flown in hope of victory, but also serve to dry the tears of defeat."
"In short, Germany during the World Cup is reminiscent of a Shakespearean midsummer night’s dream, with a touch of Woodstock to boot."
"Outside the stadiums, public screenings of the games have become joyous mass “happenings.”"
And how is the soccer?
This World Cup demonstrates three main developments that the sport has undergone.
"First, Europe and South America are more dominant than four years ago and remain the unchallenged great powers of international soccer."
So we must hope that the World Cup in South Africa in 2010 will finally bring greater global parity.
"Second, international soccer is witnessing the advent of a new generation."
"Spain, Argentina, and Germany, to name but a few countries, have put forward very young teams that have played an impressive game."
"On the French, English, and Portuguese teams, too, it is the young players that have shone – despite the continuing presence of Zidane, Beckham, and Figo."
Even the Brazilian squad is looking more aggressive and likely to score with young players like Robinho and Juninho than with their aging champions from 2002.
This generational change is accelerated by a third development.
"At the top international level, soccer has become faster and more athletic, and the top teams can shrink space on the field more effectively."
"A team that is unable to keep going at full speed for the full 90 (or more) minutes, switch from defense to offense quickly with the whole team, and maintain control of the ball to restrict their opponents' movements won’t stand much of a chance."
"Here, soccer parallels today’s globalized markets, which make similar restructuring of national economies necessary."
"Unlike economic globalization, however, it remains to be seen whether this new, fast-paced style of soccer will prevail (after all, the young blood of Spain lost to the Old Boys of France)."
The sport and its fans will certainly profit if it does.
"For now, we have a World Cup filled with soccer that is being shaped by a new, young generation both on and off the playing field – light-hearted, enthralling, and beautiful to watch."
"Let’s hope that when the last whistle blows at the final in Berlin on July 9, we Germans retain as much of this positive spirit as possible."
"Germany urgently needs this kind of optimism, because, unfortunately, two universal principles will continue to apply in the future: first, the winter will return, and, second, the ball is round and the next game is always the most difficult."
A Foreign Policy for New and Old Europe
"Watching the news from Iraq, I recall when I was Poland's Prime Minister during the Gulf War in 1991."
I watched from home on CNN as the first cruise missiles hit Baghdad.
"Hours later our military informed me that armed conflict was underway in Iraq. ``Yes, I know,'' I said. ``I've been watching the bombardment on TV.''"
"Twelve years later, Poland's Prime Minister didn't need a belated call from his military to know that war was underway in Iraq."
"All the details of the attack were provided in advance by the US, now Poland's NATO ally."
"Indeed, Poland has secured a leading role in Iraq's occupation."
What a distance Poland has travelled since communism's collapse in 1989!
"Little of this, however, is the result of design, for (unfortunately) we in Poland have not thought through what sort of foreign policy we need as a member of NATO and putative member of the European Union."
We remain narrowly focussed on whether an initiative will be immediately good or bad for us.
"Couple this with a form of foreign policy schizophrenia--some Poles think that by ``simply existing'' we influence Europe's fate; others suffer crippling pessimism, consigning Poland to permanent ``second-class'' status--and you have a recipe for inertia."
Our attitude seems to be that somehow things will sort themselves out.
"Much of Europe seems to be stuck in the same mindset: we say that we want a common foreign and security policy, but we do nothing about it until a crisis emerges."
Then we squabble about what to do.
The time for such laxity is over.
"For Poland and the other countries of East-Central Europe that have or are about to join NATO, membership in the Alliance didn't really require debate."
Our histories of oppression by powerful neighbours told us that collective security within NATO was the
"EU membership and the global war on terror, however, demand a more deeply considered response."
Why?
"Because EU membership affects every aspect of a state, economy, and society, while the war on terror demands a completely new way to conduct diplomacy and security policy."
"Today's crisis in transatlantic relations, and our accidental involvement in it as part of Donald Rumsfeld's ``New Europe,'' means that Poland (like every other European state) must now decide what it really wants from the EU and NATO."
"We must consider both our attitude to global problems that were once deemed peripheral to European interests, as well what it really means to be an EU partner."
"Only answers to these questions can reconcile the divide between the ``new'' and ``old'' Europe, as well as the new and old Atlantic worlds."
Poland as an ally of the US is not the real headache facing President Jacques Chirac or Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
"Instead, the French and German leaders are really responding to the growing unpredictability of today's emerging European order."
"They see new players (say, Spain) rising to shape EU policy, particularly foreign policy, and sense that their traditional leadership is being challenged."
But an EU with 10 new members simply cannot be run as it has for decades.
So the challenge to France and Germany does not arise because Poland is some sort of American ``Trojan Horse.''
"Instead, the EU's structure now demands not only a new consensus about Europe's role in the world, but also new means to achieve consensus."
History cannot be put on hold as Europe sorts out its internal balance of power.
"The world needs a united continent, ready to go into action."
That consensus must include the US.
"During the Cold War, most Europeans tolerated America's tendency to lead unilaterally, because of the Soviet threat and the preponderance of US power."
But America is having a hard time understanding the new circumstances of the post-Cold war era.
"Its difficulties are exacerbated by the dramatic disparity in military forces on either side of the Atlantic, and its belief that Europe's ambitions to become a military power will come to nothing because Europeans won't spend the money necessary to achieve that goal."
Here is where Poland can help bridge the Atlantic divide and forge a European consensus.
September 1939 taught every Pole that military power must be real to be effective.
Intentions don't deter invasions.
"As Danish Premier Anders Fogh Rasmussen recently said, ``France and Germany are not in a position to guarantee our country's security."
"The US is, but security does not come free of charge.''"
Most Poles think that Poland's situation is akin to Denmark's.
"Indeed, all of Europe is in thrall to American power."
But this dependence should not disguise the fact that there is a commonality of foreign policy interests between Europe and America.
"If the EU builds its foreign and security policy on the basis of recognition of this truth, many of today's divisions will disappear."
The EU's foreign policy should be guided by the following goals:
fight terrorism;
prevent local conflict;
promote human rights and democracy;
oblige unpredictable countries to become responsible;
maintain close cooperation between Europe and the US;
help poor countries.
"Polish foreign policy, like that of the EU, can only be effective in the long term if it takes realistic steps--and spends the necessary money--to realize these objectives."
"They are the only possible bedrock in transatlantic relations, in an expanded Union, and in relations between the ``New'' and ``Old'' Europe."
A Free Lunch for America
"BERKELEY – Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers had a good line at the International Monetary Fund meetings this year: governments, he said, are trying to treat a broken ankle when the patient is facing organ failure."
"Summers was criticizing Europe’s focus on the second-order issue of Greece while far graver imbalances – between the EU’s north and south, and between reckless banks’ creditors and governments that failed to regulate properly – worsen with each passing day."
"But, on the other side of the Atlantic, Americans have no reason to feel smug."
"Summers could have used the same metaphor to criticize the United States, where the continued focus on the long-run funding dilemmas of social insurance is sucking all of the oxygen out of efforts to deal with America’s macroeconomic and unemployment crisis."
The US government can currently borrow for 30 years at a real (inflation-adjusted) interest rate of 1% per year.
"Suppose that the US government were to borrow an extra $500 billion over the next two years and spend it on infrastructure – even unproductively, on projects for which the social rate of return is a measly 25% per year."
Suppose that – as seems to be the case – the simple Keynesian government-expenditure multiplier on this spending is only two.
"In that case, the $500 billion of extra federal infrastructure spending over the next two years would produce $1 trillion of extra output of goods and services, generate approximately seven million person-years of extra employment, and push down the unemployment rate by two percentage points in each of those years."
"And, with tighter labor-force attachment on the part of those who have jobs, the unemployment rate thereafter would likely be about 0.1 percentage points lower in the indefinite future."
The impressive gains don’t stop there.
Better infrastructure would mean an extra $20 billion a year of income and social welfare.
A lower unemployment rate into the future would mean another $20 billion a year in higher production.
And half of the extra $1 trillion of goods and services would show up as consumption goods and services for American households.
"In sum, on the benefits side of the equation: more jobs now, $500 billion of additional consumption of goods and services over the next two years, and then a $40 billion a year flow of higher incomes and production each year thereafter."
"So, what are the likely costs of an extra $500 billion in infrastructure spending over the next two years?"
"For starters, the $500 billion of extra government spending would likely be offset by $300 billion of increased tax collections from higher economic activity."
So the net result would be a $200 billion increase in the national debt.
"American taxpayers would then have to pay $2 billion a year in real interest on that extra national debt over the next 30 years, and then pay off or roll over the entire $200 billion."
"The $40 billion a year of higher economic activity would, however, generate roughly $10 billion a year in additional tax revenue."
"Using some of it to pay the real interest on the debt and saving the rest would mean that when the bill comes due, the tax-financed reserves generated by the healthier economy would be more than enough to pay off the additional national debt."
"In other words, taxpayers win, because the benefits from the healthier economy would more than compensate for the costs of servicing the higher national debt, enabling the government to provide more services without raising tax rates."
"Households win, too, because they get to buy more and nicer things with their incomes."
"Companies win, because goods and workers get to use the improved infrastructure."
"The unemployed win, because some of them get jobs."
"And even bond investors win, because they get their money back, with the interest for which they contracted."
So what is not to like?
Nothing.
"How, you might ask, can I say this? I am an economist – a professor of the Dismal Science, in which there are no free lunches, in which benefits are always balanced by costs, and in which stories that sound too good to be true almost inevitably are."
But there are two things different about today.
"First, the US labor market is failing so badly that expanded government spending carries no resource cost to society as a whole."
"Second, bond investors are being really stupid."
"In a world in which the S&amp;P 500 has a 7% annual earnings yield, nobody should be happy holding a US government 30-year inflation-adjusted bond that yields 1% per year."
That six-percentage-point difference in anticipated real yield is a measure of bond investors’ extraordinary and irrational panic. They are willing to pay 6% per year for “safety.”
"Right now, however, the US government can manufacture “safety” out of thin air merely by printing bonds."
"The government, too, would then win by pocketing that 6% per year of value – though 30 years from now, bondholders who feel like winners now would most likely look at their portfolios’ extraordinarily poor performance of over 2011-2041 and rue their strategy."
A French Cure for the Resource Curse
NEW YORK – The campaign to ensure that companies engaged in extractive activities disclose all of their payments in their host countries is gaining momentum – and France is leading the effort.
"President Nicolas Sarkozy should be applauded for supporting a new initiative promoting strict transparency standards for petroleum, gas, and mining companies listed on European stock exchanges."
"France, at the heart of the European Union and President of both the G-8 and G-20 this year, is in an exceptional position to encourage such a regulatory move."
"With French leadership, 2011 offers a golden opportunity for the most important capital markets to adopt clear, precise rules requiring full financial disclosure by extractive-industry companies to governmental authorities."
"Oil, gas, and mining generate billions of dollars per year for governments and companies."
"Moreover, these industries often play a central role in the economic development of resource-rich countries."
"Yet, despite great natural wealth, a majority of people in these countries lives in poverty."
"The actual taxes and payments made by mining, oil, and other extractive-industry companies to governments are usually a well-kept secret, even though most of these governments claim to use the revenue for the public good."
"In reality, in far too many countries, ordinary citizens do not benefit from any of this money; in fact, they must bear the brunt of the environmental and social costs imposed by mining and drilling operations."
"Indeed, these well-kept industry and government secrets can have serious and widespread repercussions. Witness the upheaval in North Africa and the Middle East."
"In these countries, many of which are rich in oil and gas, citizens are staging protests against corruption and political repression."
"At bottom, they are protesting against the mismanagement of their countries’ wealth and resources – with implications that affect the security and affordability of the entire world’s energy supplies."
Transparency is an essential part of the solution.
"Citizens everywhere must be assured that oil and gas firms, as well as mining companies, publish all of their relevant financial information, broken down by country and by project, and including all payments made to host-country public budgets."
"If European regulators can agree on this requirement for all extractive-industry companies listed on their stock exchanges, this transparency norm will be applied to companies regardless of where their headquarters are located."
"Regulators must also stipulate that company reports be made available on a regular, timely basis, and that they are easily accessible and comparable across countries and other extractive companies."
"The United States has already passed legislation requiring public disclosure of payments to governments, through the 2010 Dodd-Frank law."
That law’s requirement that companies fully disclose their revenue streams by country and by project applies to 90% of international oil and gas companies and to eight of the ten largest mining companies.
"This will help citizens track how that money is used, but it will not help them to assess whether their governments are collecting a fair share."
"If the EU were to require companies to publish detailed information regarding production and operational numbers, financial and accounting balances, and payments to authorities, companies would become truly accountable to citizens, and government revenues would be augmented."
"Such regulatory reform is now under consideration by the European Commission, and French support is imperative if the EU is to announce this month the necessary legislative moves to promote transparency."
"French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde recently highlighted the necessity of promoting “initiatives within industrial sectors that aim to enhance governance, integrity, and transparency in economic transactions.”"
"At its just-completed summit in Deauville, France, the G-8 called for the first time for mandatory reporting by oil, gas, and mining companies."
"This is an important advance, but, unfortunately, it is qualified by language that allows voluntary approaches as an alternative, and it focuses only on payments transparency."
"Now the world must look to the G-20 summit in Cannes this November to make an unequivocal commitment to the reporting requirements needed, given that important emerging economies such as Brazil, India, and China, as well as South Africa and other resource-rich African countries, will be at the table."
The importance of financial transparency in the extractive industries is not limited to one country or era – and it is too important to be left to voluntary efforts alone.
"Greater accountability and stronger governance for such companies could potentially change lives, economies, and political systems around the world."
A French Presidential Primer
The late British Prime Minister Harold Wilson used to quip that “a week is a long time in politics.”
"So, in the 30 or so weeks between now and the next French presidential election, any prediction made today could be reversed, and reversed again, before the vote. But two candidates have emerged as clear and constant favorites in opinion polls: Nicolas Sarkozy on the right and Ségolène Royal on the left."
"In fact, they have more in common than meets the eye, for each speaks of a rupture with the past while incarnating a form of continuity."
"For Sarkozy, “rupture” reflects both mundanely tactical and deeply personal choices."
"The 12 years of Jacques Chirac‘s presidency, together with France’s tradition of alternation in power, suggests a victory for the left."
Positioning himself as the candidate who represents a sharp break with today’s unpopular politics is the only means to escape that fate.
This is reflected in Sarkozy’s openly pro-American stance – an act of political courage in a France where anti-Americanism is running high.
"Sarkozy’s message is that Chirac and Villepin were right in substance to oppose America’s military adventure in Iraq, but that their style was disastrously wrong."
"Thus, his deep admiration for “American values,” while sincere, implies no embrace of President George W. Bush."
"It also reassures the French business community, which was shocked by Dominique de Villepin’s flamboyant opposition to the United States when he was Chirac’s foreign minister."
"At home, Sarkozy has aimed his message particularly at the young, issuing a patriotic call to the values of work and discipline, a counter-revolutionary revolution."
"The revolution that must be overcome is that of May 1968, whose leaders and supporters, according to Sarkozy, may have lost politically to de Gaulle, but deeply weakened France over the succeeding decades with their emphasis on “false values.”"
"By contrast, rebelling against one’s parents’ generation and rediscovering traditional moral stances will save France – a message that is highly applicable to issues, such as education and immigration, that may dominate the electoral campaign."
"In the case of Royal, the meaning of “rupture” is both more obvious and more visible."
She is seeking to become the first woman President of the French Republic.
"To achieve her goal, she prefers to emphasize her “essence,” thereby countering Sarkozy’s stress on his record as a “doer.”"
"Her appeal to voters is simple: “I am a woman, and you have never tried a woman, so be modern and try one now.”"
"Hiding behind the originality (in French presidential politics) of her gender, Royal has avoided specifying a detailed program."
"When challenged by inquisitive journalists demanding greater precision about her policy agenda, her highly effective line of defense (so far!) has been: “You would not dare to ask me such a question if I were not a woman!”"
"Thus, Royal’s program is her popularity."
"In foreign policy, one can only guess what her priorities would be."
"As far as Europe is concerned, she seems as “agnostic” as Sarkozy, who, like her, incarnates a new generation of “post-European” leaders."
"In terms of values, Royal, too, seems to represent a rupture with May 1968, with her emphasis on discipline and family."
"According to public opinion polls, Royal is the clear favorite of the left and the only candidate able to defeat Sarkozy."
Her support is particularly strong among women voters.
"For the Socialist Party, which is eager to return to power but has not yet recovered from the humiliating defeat of Lionel Jospin in the first round of the presidential election in 2002, the question is whether it can afford to resist the wave of favorable public opinion behind Royal."
"In the opinion of Royal’s many opponents among Socialist leaders and militants, the dominance of the media in the political process is leading to mediocrity: the qualities required to be elected are becoming nearly incompatible with those needed to govern."
"According to Royal’s Socialist critics, the “Hollywoodization” of politics from which she benefits entails a new approach in which leaders follow and followers lead."
But the same criticism can be directed at Sarkozy.
"Moreover, both candidates embody continuity – with Chirac’s Gaullist side for Sarkozy and with François Mitterrand for Royal – as much as rupture."
"Royal openly claims Mitterand’s legacy as she searches for legitimacy, while Sarkozy’s rejection of Chirac’s legacy has more to do with form than substance."
"To a large extent, Sarkozy can be seen as Chirac with more, whereas Royal is clearly Mitterrand with less."
"When the voters decide in the spring of 2007, their choice may depend more on negative than positive considerations, as it did in 2002, when Chirac faced the odious nationalist Jean-Marie Le Pen in the second round."
"As in 2002, the winner next year will be whomever the electorate dislikes or fears less. But one way or the other, personalities will prevail over programs."
A Fresh Start for China and Japan?
"Edmonton – Chinese President Hu Jintao will make a high-profile visit to Japan from May 6-10, making him the second Chinese head of state ever to travel there."
"The trip is being carefully managed by both countries, and is being watched closely around the world, with good reason: Sino-Japanese relations over the past decade have been turbulent, to say the least."
"When Hu’s predecessor, Jiang Zemin, traveled to Japan ten years ago, bilateral relations were deteriorating: China was unhappy with the Japanese government’s refusal to extend the same apology offered to South Korea for past aggression; Japan was worried about a rising China and thus turning more confrontational."
"The Japanese media’s coverage of the visit was overwhelmingly negative, and it was remembered as a public-relations disaster."
"Hu succeeded Jiang in 2002, almost as former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi was coming to power in Japan, and encouraged “New Thinking” in China’s Japan policy, which would entail moving away from historical grievances and promoting better ties. But, instead of accepting China’s olive branch, Koizumi implemented a more nationalistic agenda, including annual visits to the Yasukuni Shine, which is regarded as a symbol of Japanese militarism by Japan’s neighbors."
"His hard-line approach isolated Japan and angered China, leading to an outburst of anti-Japanese demonstrations in China in 2005."
But both Japan and China recognize that further tension will serve neither country’s long-term interests.
"Koizumi’s successors, Prime Ministers Shinzo Abe and Yasuo Fukuda, have sought to engage China over the past two years, with summits in Beijing and a successful visit by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to Japan last year."
Hu’s trip is likely follow the example set by Wen.
"He will emphasize common strategic interests, highlight mutual economic benefits, generate positive public opinion, and promote further exchanges."
"Japan is not only one of China’s largest trade and investment partners, it is also the most powerful neighbor with which China wants to be on good terms, partly to showcase that China’s rise is not a threat to Asia and the rest of the world."
"Japan, whose economic recovery is attributable largely to its deepening ties with China in recent years, is also eager to demonstrate that it regards China not as a threat but as an opportunity, as least in economic terms."
"It was 30 years ago that former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda, the father of today’s prime minister, signed a Peace and Friendship Treaty with China."
The two governments will certainly use Hu’s visit to celebrate the anniversary with new programs designed to enhance bilateral understanding and friendship.
"But, unlike three decades ago, when the Japanese regarded China as one of their most favored countries, public opinion in both countries nowadays registers more negative feelings than positive ones."
"Behind the smiles, the polite interactions, and the cautiously worded diplomatic language, strong undercurrents of suspicion remain."
One problem is the disputed waters of the East China Sea.
"Despite new joint projects in energy efficiency and environmental protection, areas in which China ranks Japan as the best performer among industrialized countries, the two sides remain in bitterly divided over these territorial waters, which contain huge potential oil, gas, and other mineral deposits."
"Even after many rounds of talks, no resolution is in sight, and Hu’s visit is not expected to produce any breakthroughs."
Then there are strategic suspicions.
"Fukuda has dropped Abe’s talk about an “arch of freedom” – an effort to forge a bloc with the United States, Australia, and India. But Japan remains concerned about China’s rapidly modernizing military, while China worries about a potential US-Japan containment strategy for China, especially in the case of a crisis in the Taiwan Straits."
"So, although both sides endorse the idea of a “mutually beneficial strategic relationship,” and despite progress bilateral on military exchanges, mutual trust and confidence-building have a long way to go."
"Moreover, today’s “warm politics, cool economics” trend is the reverse of the “cold politics, warm economics” pattern under Koizumi."
"Last year, Japan’s committed investment projects in China fell 24% from 2006, while actual investment volume decreased by 25%, partly owing to regulatory changes in China regarding foreign investment."
"Recent food safety issues, such as the “poisoned dumplings” cases, have clearly heightened the Japanese public’s sensitivity about Chinese exports."
"Finally, historical issues could still resurface to cause new problems."
"While Fukuda has made it clear that he will not visit the Yasukuni Shrine, 160 other parliamentarians paid homage at the site last month, an indication that conservative forces in Japan remain strong and that future prime ministers may not abstain from visiting Yasukuni. And Japan has so far failed to live up to its treaty obligations to clean up between 700,000 and two million chemical weapons that were abandoned in China by the Japanese army at the end of World War II, another potential flash point if any of these weapons causes casualties in China."
A Fresh Start for Europe in Latin America?
"MILAN – By 2050, Brazil and Mexico will be among the world’s six leading economies, according to analysts at the investment bank Goldman Sachs."
Does the European Union care?
Is Latin America to be Europe’s next missed business opportunity?
"Latin America has a population of 550 million, with average yearly per capita income of $4,000, immense natural resources, and substantial human capital."
It accounts for 8% of world production and grew by more than 5% in each of the past three years.
"Although the United States remains the main destination of Latin American and Caribbean exports, Asia is becoming an increasingly important market for goods based on natural resources."
"During the past four years, Latin America attracted an annual average of $61 billion in foreign direct investment, 60% of which went to Brazil and Mexico."
"In the 1990’s, foreign investors were chiefly attracted by privatization programs in the region, but more recently mergers and acquisitions and greenfield projects have been the most common type of investment."
"Predictably, Spain is the most important European investor in the region, though several important Spanish operations have recently passed to Italian companies, among them the utility Endesa, acquired by Enel, which is now the biggest private energy distributor in Latin America."
"Meanwhile, Latin American businesses have been increasing their own foreign investments."
"In 2006, Brazil invested $28.2 billion abroad, compared to inflows of $18.8 billion."
"Indeed, emerging giants from Latin America and Asia will be at the center of worldwide investment in the coming decades."
"In 2006, Italy’s Fiat Group and India’s Tata Motors established a joint venture to make passenger vehicles and engines in India."
"The following year, they extended their partnership to Latin America, investing $80 million in production of a Tata pick-up truck at Fiat’s factory in Cordoba, Argentina."
It is to be hoped that many more major European corporations will follow suit.
"But small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) – the majority of firms in both Latin America and Europe – find it difficult to trade and invest at international level, in part because of high transaction and information costs."
"In Europe, clusters of SMEs appear able to achieve economies of scale and scope, and thus to succeed collectively in global markets."
This European experience is now being widely studied in Latin America.
"In Brazil, four local production systems have combined to form Project Promos/Sebrae/BID, based on the example of Italy’s industrial districts."
"Between 2002 and 2006, Brazil’s SME support services and the Milan Chamber of Commerce created partnerships involving furniture, shoes, designer lingerie, and handicrafts from different regions of the country."
This approach may well be the shape of things to come.
"But, while the EU’s association agreement with Mexico is 10 years old, it does not yet have a strategic partnership with Brazil."
"This is partly because of the never-ending negotiation process with Mercosur, the troubled – and still incomplete – Latin American customs union."
"The EU is currently negotiating trade liberalization deals with all of Latin America’s regional blocs: Mercosur, the Caribbean Community, the Central America Common Market, and the Andean Community."
The EU must urge its Latin American partners towards further integration.
"Adopting a common “rule of origin” for their products would be an incentive to liberalize their international trade further, thus increasing it."
"Full trade liberalization in Latin America, although difficult to achieve, must be made central to EU strategy, and would boost economic growth."
"But even if tariffs and quotas are progressively reduced, trade flows may remain low if other trade costs remain high. EU cooperation thus should be directed to lowering trade costs."
The crucial issue is market access.
"Most Latin American countries still get poor results from their efforts to export to Europe, the exceptions being raw materials and energy resources."
"After the establishment of the EU-Chile free-trade area, Chilean exports to the EU increased substantially."
"But in the case of EU-Mexico trade liberalization, the growth of imports from the EU has exceeded the growth of exports to Europe, resulting in a widening Mexican trade deficit with the EU."
This is at odds with the EU’s proclamations since the 1999 Rio summit that Latin America is a vital political and economic partner.
A change in Europe’s approach is needed if a strategic partnership is to be created.
The European Commission understands this.
"Although the EU does not have a strategic partnership with Brazil, it intends to push ahead with one as fast as possible."
"In mid-2007, the Commission confirmed that it will revisit the EU’s dialogue with Mercosur, with the aim of giving new impetus to negotiations."
But there is also keen awareness that the EU’s hope for a special relationship with Brazil must not be allowed to hinder regional integration or worsen asymmetries and imbalances within the bloc.
"If Latin America is to become a strategic partner for the EU and a more attractive market for European companies, European institutions must become more open to the region’s needs."
"A fresh start by the EU with Brazil and Mexico could prove promising, because of the “pull” it might have on other countries. But this must be accompanied by measures to keep all Latin American countries on board."
"Otherwise, Latin America may well prove to be Europe’s next missed business opportunity."
Africa at Risk
ADDIS ABABA – Climate change will hit Africa – a continent that has contributed virtually nothing to bring it about – first and hardest.
"Aside from Antarctica, Africa is the only continent that has not industrialized."
"Indeed, since 1980’s the industrialization that had taken place in Africa has by and large been reversed."
Africa has thus contributed nothing to the historical accumulation of greenhouse gases through carbon-based industrialization.
"Moreover, its current contribution is also negligible, practically all of it coming from deforestation and degradation of forests and farmland."
"Yet climate change will hit Africa hardest, because it will cripple the continent’s vulnerable agricultural sector, on which 70% of the population depends."
"All estimates of the possible impact of global warming suggest that a large part of the continent will become drier, and that the continent as a whole will experience greater climatic variability."
We know what the impact of periodic droughts have been on the lives of tens of millions of Africans.
We can therefore imagine what the impact of a drier climate on agriculture is likely to be.
Conditions in this vital economic sector will become even more precarious than they currently are.
"Africa will not only be hit hardest, but it will be hit first."
"Indeed, the long dreaded impact of climate change is already upon us."
The current drought covering much of East Africa – far more severe than past droughts – has been directly associated with climate change.
The upcoming climate negotiations ought to address the specific problems of Africa and similarly vulnerable poor parts of the world.
"This requires, first and most importantly, reducing global warming to the apparently inevitable increase of two degrees Celsius, beyond which lies an environmental catastrophe that could be unmanageable for poor and vulnerable countries."
"Second, adequate resources should be made available to poor and vulnerable regions and countries to enable them to adapt to climate change."
"Climate change, which was largely brought about by the activities of developed countries, has made it difficult for poor and vulnerable countries to fight poverty."
It has created a more hostile environment for development.
No amount of money will undo the damage done.
But adequate investment in mitigating the damage could partly resolve the problem.
Developed countries are thus morally obliged to pay partial compensation to poor and vulnerable countries and regions to cover part of the cost of the investments needed to adapt to climate change.
Various estimates have been made of the scale of investment required by those countries.
"One conservative estimate – which has a reasonable chance of being accepted precisely because it is conservative – calls for $50 billion per year as of 2015, increasing to $100 billion by 2020 and beyond."
A transitional financing arrangement would be put in place for the period 2010-2015.
"Some argue that developed countries cannot come up with such sums, particularly given their current economic challenges."
But no one has so far argued that the cost of damage caused to the development prospects of poor countries and regions is less than the amount of compensation being offered to cover adjustment costs.
The reason is obvious: the damage caused is many times higher than the compensation being requested.
"Nonetheless, it is argued, whatever the real cost of the damage, developed countries currently cannot afford to provide that kind of money."
"But we all know that these countries and their national banks were able to spend trillions of dollars in a few months to bail out their bankers, who earned super-profits when the going was good."
"When the good times ended, taxpayers and governments were prepared to rescue them and to ensure that they continued to receive their extraordinary bonuses."
"If the developed world is able to pay trillions of dollars to clean up its bankers’ mess, how is it possible that it cannot afford to pay billions of dollars to clean up a mess that it created, and that is threatening the survival of whole continents?"
Clearly this is not about the availability of resources.
It is about the inappropriate priorities in how resources are allocated.
"It is about moral values that make it appropriate to rescue bankers, who expect everyone but themselves to pay for the mess they created, and inappropriate to compensate the world’s poorest people, whose survival is threatened precisely because of the mess created by developed countries."
"I cannot believe that people in developed counties, when informed about the issues, would support rescuing bankers and oppose partial compensation for poor countries and regions."
I cannot believe that they will let such an injustice occur.
"If they are not expressing their outrage over the injustice of it all, it can only be because they are inadequately informed."
"Africa, Climate Change, and the G-8 Summit"
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has declared that the two issues at the center of the G-8 Summit this July will be African poverty and global climate change.
"These may seem to be distinct issues. In fact, they are linked."
A trip I took to a village in the Tigre region in northern Ethiopia shows why.
"One morning, I was taken to a dry riverbed at the village’s edge."
"Farmers were digging a pit in the riverbed, down to the water table approximately two meters below ground level."
They explained that until recently this was a perennial river – one that flows throughout the year – but now the river stops flowing during the dry season.
Only when the annual rains begin in the summer does water reappear in the river bed.
"Until then, water-starved communities dig for water, if they can find it and if they can afford to pump it out."
"In northern Ethiopia, as in much of Africa, the rain cycle has changed markedly in recent years."
"Ethiopian village life has long depended on two crops, one during a short rain in March and April, and the main crop during the long rain in the summer months."
"In recent years, the short rains have failed entirely, and long rains have been erratic."
Hunger is omnipresent.
Perhaps half of the children are severely underweight.
"Much of arid sub-Saharan Africa, notably in the Sahel (the region just south of the Sahara desert), has experienced a pronounced drop in rainfall over the past quarter-century."
"This decline coincided with a rise in the surface temperature of the neighboring Indian Ocean, a hint that the decline in rainfall is in fact part of the longer-term process of man-made global warming."
"Failures of rainfall contribute not only to famines and chronic hunger, but also to the onset of violence when hungry people clash over scarce food and water."
"When violence erupts in water-starved regions such as Darfur, Sudan, political leaders tend to view the problems in narrow political terms."
"If they act at all, they mobilize peacekeepers, international sanctions, and humanitarian aid."
"But Darfur, like Tigre, needs a development strategy to fight hunger and drought even more than it needs peacekeepers."
Soldiers cannot keep peace among desperately hungry people.
One course of action must be to help impoverished African regions to “adapt” to climate change and to escape the poverty trap.
"Water-stressed regions like Ethiopia and Sudan can adapt, at least in part, through improved technologies such as “drip irrigation,” rainwater harvesting, improved water storage facilities, deep wells, and agro-forestry techniques that make best use of scarce rainfall."
"Better land-management practices (the re-planting of degraded forests, for example) can recharge underground water aquifers."
Poor countries cannot afford these technologies on their own.
Nor should they have to.
"Help for poor countries in Africa and elsewhere to adapt to climate change should not be described as charity or aid, but rather as compensation for damages being imposed on the poorest people on the planet."
Greater help for these countries to escape from extreme poverty has been promised for decades but has not been delivered.
"In addition to adapting to climate change, the world must also reduce future risks to the planet by cutting back on emissions of greenhouse gases, which are the source of man-made climate change."
While adaptation to climate change is necessary – because it is already occurring – this is not enough.
"If the world fails to mitigate future climate change, the effects of rising temperatures, increasing droughts, more numerous and severe tropical storms, rising sea levels, and a spread of tropical diseases will pose huge threats to the entire planet."
The famines in Ethiopia and the violence in Darfur suggest what can lie ahead.
The best way to reduce long-term climate change is to reduce carbon emissions.
"There are at least three options: shift to non-carbon energy sources such as solar or nuclear energy; capture and dispose of the carbon dioxide emitted at carbon-based power plants; economize on energy use, for example by shifting to hybrid automobiles and trucks."
"Most likely, all three of these methods will have to play a role."
"The effort to reduce greenhouse gases will require decades of action, but, given the long lead times in overhauling the world’s energy systems, we must start now."
Rich countries need to lead the way.
"It is ironic that the United States, which portrays itself as a friend of democracy and impoverished countries, gives the smallest share of its GNP in aid among the rich countries, and also refuses to participate in global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"This is especially ironic because African countries like Ethiopia stand steadfastly and bravely with the US in the fight for freedom and against terrorism, even as they struggle with hunger, disease, and famine."
"Moreover, countries like Ethiopia are making valiant, indeed remarkable, efforts to overcome their problems, despite the lack of adequate, and long-promised, help from the world’s richest countries."
"Africans suffering from hunger and drought, and indeed poor people everywhere, have a right to ask much more of the US and other rich countries."
Tony Blair is right to call on his rich-country colleagues to follow through on their unfulfilled promises.
Africa’s Path from Poverty
BEIJING – All low-income countries have the potential for dynamic economic growth.
"We know this because we have seen it happen repeatedly: a poor, agrarian economy transforms itself into a middle- or even high-income urban economy in one or two generations."
The key is to capture the window of opportunity for industrialization arising from the relocation of light manufacturing from higher-income countries.
"That was true in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and it remains true today."
"Japan seized its opportunity in the years following World War II, using labor-intensive industries, such as textiles and simple electronics, to drive its economy until rising labor costs eroded its comparative advantage in those sectors."
"That shift then allowed other low-income Asian economies – South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and to some extent Malaysia and Thailand – to follow in Japan's footsteps."
"China, of course, is the region's most recent traveler along this well-trodden path."
"After more than three decades of breakneck economic growth, it has transformed itself from one of the poorest countries on earth to the world's largest economy."
"And now that China, too, is beginning to lose its comparative advantage in labor-intensive industries, other developing countries – especially in Africa – are set to take its place."
"Indeed, ever since the Industrial Revolution, the rise of light manufacturing has driven a dramatic rise in national income."
The United Kingdom's economic transformation started with textiles.
"In Belgium, France, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, and Switzerland, light manufacturing led the way."
"Similarly, in the United States, cities like Boston, Baltimore, and Philadelphia became centers for producing textiles, garments, and shoes."
"Until recently, few believed that Africa, too, could become a center for modern manufacturing."
"But, with the right policies, there is no reason why African countries could not follow a similar trajectory."
"Consider land-locked Ethiopia, which only ten years ago seemed to be an especially bad bet."
But then the country built an industrial park near Addis Ababa and invited the Chinese shoemaker Huajian to open a factory there.
Huajian opened its doors in January 2012 with two production lines and some 600 workers.
"By the end of the year, it had employed 2,000 Ethiopians and doubled the country's exports of leather shoes."
"Today, the company has 3,500 workers in Ethiopia producing more than two million shoes a year."
"In 2013, spurred by Huajian's success, the Ethiopian government created a new industrial park, with space for 22 factory units."
"Within three months, all of them had been leased by export-oriented companies from Turkey, Korea, Taiwan, China, and elsewhere."
The World Bank has provided $250 million to support the continued construction of these industrial parks.
The Ethiopian success story is just the start.
"As investors learn more about Africa, they will increasingly see what it has to offer."
"Indeed, the cost of labor in Africa is competitive enough that Ethiopia could attract companies from countries as poor as Bangladesh."
Africa has a surplus of agricultural labor and too few other jobs.
"As foreign firms launch operations in the labor-intensive sectors in which Africa has a comparative advantage, they will train the local workforce."
Some workers will become managers.
They will become familiar with the technology and learn how to maintain consistent quality in the production line.
They will establish contacts with international buyers and investors.
"And, eventually, some of them will be able to raise capital and start firms of their own – export companies owned and operated by Africans."
Mauritius shows the path ahead.
"In the 1970s, the government set up industrial parks to process textiles and garments for export."
"At the time, most of the owners were from Taiwan or Hong Kong; today, more than 70% of the island's industrial companies are locally owned."
A carefully focused export strategy is crucial.
"The international development community and many African governments want to work toward regional integration, linking the markets of 55 African countries."
"This might have its advantages, but it should not be a priority."
"Africa today accounts for just 1.9% of global GDP, compared to 21% for the United States and 23% for Europe."
"Developing countries must use their limited resources in the most effective way, and there is no question where the most attractive opportunities in Africa are to be found."
"For example, instead of investing heavily in the infrastructure needed for regional integration, a country like Ethiopia would be better off building industrial parks and linking them by road to ports in Djibouti."
"With the right growth strategy, far-reaching change can come within a person's lifetime – sometimes more than once."
My native Taiwan is now a high-income economy.
"But when I was born there, in 1952, the island was poorer than almost every country in Africa."
Then it happened to me again.
"I moved to mainland China in 1979, when the country's per capita income was less than one-third of Sub-Saharan Africa's."
"Today, China has become an upper-middle-income country, and it is on track to become a high-income country by 2020."
"My hope is that I can witness a third economic transformation in my lifetime, this time in Ethiopia and other countries in Africa."
"If they stay on the tried and tested path of those who have gone before, there is every chance that I will."
African Misrule on Trial
"THE HAGUE – As the world focuses on the inauguration of America’s first black president and celebrates an important milestone in the ongoing struggle for racial equality, recent developments across the Atlantic represent significant progress in a related global campaign to end impunity for mass crimes."
"In the coming days, judges sitting on the International Criminal Court in The Hague will decide whether to issue a warrant for the arrest of Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for the crime of genocide. And on January 26, the ICC will begin its first trial – that of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, a former Congolese warlord."
"Neither event is earth shattering, but, taken together, these two steps mean that a new system of international justice is working."
Government and rebel leaders around the globe have been put on notice that criminal conduct will no longer be given a free pass.
"Although the threatened indictment of al-Bashir has prompted protest in Khartoum, no one expects him to appear in court soon."
"As for Lubanga, he is one of many in the Congo who has used civilians as pawns in a war that has cost more than five million lives in the past decade."
"Though serious, the charges against him – recruiting child soldiers – do not pretend to encompass the range of abuses committed."
"Five years after the world’s first permanent criminal tribunal commenced operations, it has made its mark."
"The ICC has opened four active investigations, issued public charges against twelve people, and to date secured custody of four."
"Nonetheless, the Court has come under fire for three alleged failings."
"First, some argue that by interjecting itself into ongoing conflicts, the ICC has impeded efforts to secure peace. But the facts on the ground do not bear this out."
"In northern Uganda, ICC charges against leaders of the rebel Lord’s Resistance Army have helped bring an end to years of brutal fighting, and marginalized the LRA’s chief, Joseph Kony."
"Similarly, in Sudan’s Darfur region, there has been no genuine peace process to disrupt, as attacks on civilians continue to be reported, even after the United Nations Security Council referred the matter to the ICC in 2005."
"Even so, the ICC prosecutor’s application for an arrest warrant for al-Bashir – announced this past July – has yet to provoke a widely-feared crackdown on humanitarian organizations."
"On the contrary, it may have prompted the arrest of a lower-level indictee for crimes in Darfur."
"In short, more law, rather than less, is needed to help stem the violence."
"Second, the ICC is said to have allowed itself to become a tool of national political leaders."
The fact that national governments referred three of the Court’s four active cases – and that in each of those cases only armed rebels or government opponents have been charged so far – has contributed to this perception.
Navigating this interplay between law and politics is perhaps the ICC’s greatest challenge.
"On the one hand, the Court’s actions often have political consequences: however well-founded, accusing the leader of a rebel army may be seen as taking sides in a conflict."
"On the other hand, the Court cannot charge – or refrain from charging – a senior political or military official responsible for grave crimes solely to avert negative political repercussions."
"Nor would it be proper, where the gravity and scale of crimes materially differ, to charge all sides in a conflict in order to preserve a false sense of parity."
Both of these complaints reflect a third: unease with the Court’s overwhelming focus on Africa.
Some suggest that this is yet another example of Western institutions applying to Africa principles that they don’t apply to themselves.
The long history of Africa’s exploitation demands that this concern not be dismissed out of hand.
"Nevertheless, Africa is the site of many of the world’s worst conflicts."
Nor is the ICC a foreign body.
"Thirty African governments have ratified the ICC’s governing statute, and several of the Court’s 18 judges hail from Africa, as does a substantial portion of its staff."
"Still, the Court should not hesitate to act outside Africa when mass atrocities demand redress."
The experience of other war crimes tribunals suggests that questions about political bias may take years to overcome.
"Only by demonstrating professionalism in its work, and willingness to hold senior government figures accountable where appropriate, can the ICC engender broad and lasting support."
"Over time, the ICC’s example should foster more effective national and regional prosecutions of serious crimes such as genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes."
"For now, the Court can best address skeptics by more regularly and transparently explaining itself – its decisions, its mandate, and its constraints – to a global public to whom it ultimately must answer."
African Muslims In The Islamic World
Nigeria has been convulsed by religious violence triggered by the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad published in a Danish newspaper months ago.
"The violence began in the northern Nigerian city of Maiduguri during a protest by Muslims against the cartoons, with the Christian Association of Nigeria reporting at least 50 Christians killed."
"Reprisals were swift, and at least 50 Muslims were killed in three days of violence in the southeastern (predominantly Christian) cities of Onitsha and Enugu."
"The Nigerian protests against the cartoons (so far the most violent in Africa) raise the question: what is the role and position of African Muslims (or more accurately, sub-Saharan African Muslims) in the “Islamic World”?"
"When people in the rest of the world use the term “Islamic World” do they include in it sub-Saharan African Muslims, or do they have in mind only the Muslims of the Middle East and Asia?"
"Muslims in sub-Saharan Africa do not share many characteristics with Muslims in other parts of the world, especially those of the Arab world."
"Sub-Saharan African Muslims are less assertive, and they face considerably more difficulties in their attempts to articulate their rights and establish their presence in their respective states and regions."
Part of the difficulty arises from the perpetual African dilemma of identity.
"Africa has been described as a continent having a triple heritage, and the African Muslim, too, has a split personality."
"He must decide whether he is a Muslim first, then a member of his tribe, say, Hausa, and then of his nation, say, Nigeria."
"Even though Muslim practice is strong in Africa, there is widespread incorporation of traditional African rituals in ceremonies like weddings and funerals."
"For example, among the Luhya in Western Kenya, it is not uncommon for Muslims to slaughter animals during funerals, even though, strictly speaking, there is no such provision in Islam."
Muslims in many sub-Saharan African states are also minorities.
"They do not form a formidable presence, as in Nigeria, where some Muslim-majority states in the north have even implemented Sharia Law, making them more or less Islamic states."
"Nevertheless, the Federal Republic of Nigeria is a secular state, as are almost all sub-Saharan African states."
The colonial legacy also helps account for the relatively docile nature of Muslims in sub-Saharan Africa.
The colonial powers’ arbitrary demarcation of borders lumped together in one state diverse ethnic groups which may have been historical antagonists.
"Colonial political economy also concentrated “development” in resource-rich areas, while neglecting resource-poor regions and their populations, which in many cases were Muslim."
Thus we see a relatively poor Hausa-Muslim majority population in northern Nigeria and a relatively rich Ibo-Christian majority population in oil-rich southeastern Nigeria; a relatively rich Christian majority population in central Kenya and a relatively poor Muslim majority population on the coast and in the northeastern provinces; and so on.
"As political power tends to polarize around economic power, sub-Saharan African Muslims have been under-represented in these mostly centralized political systems."
"Moreover, Muslims in these mostly patron-client states have been forced to identify more with atomistic/parochial ethnic nationalism in order to enjoy the “fruits of independence” and thus acquire whatever political representation they have. This has led to a related problem in countries bordering the Indian Ocean: disunity between coastal, more Arabized Muslims and the non-Arabized Muslims of the interior."
It is no exaggeration to argue that the more Arabized African Muslims along the Kenyan and Tanzanian coasts (including the island of Zanzibar) consider themselves “more Muslim” than the less Arabized Muslims inland.
Muslim political participation in sub-Saharan Africa has thus been extremely limited.
"Political Islam is an almost unknown phenomenon in this region (the Islamic Party of Kenya was never registered, for example), and Muslim organizations have mostly focused on welfare and rights."
"However, Muslims in sub-Saharan Africa, like most Muslims around the world, exhibit an “us versus them” mentality."
"When Muslims form a minority, they have tended to co-exist peacefully with other religions, but where their populations are substantial (as in Nigeria), they tend to assert themselves."
"Whatever ethnic and other divisions are at stake, the “us versus them” sentiment has played a large role in fomenting religious conflict in Nigeria."
"Nevertheless, Nigeria (and perhaps Zanzibar) remains an exception in Islamic assertiveness in sub-Saharan Africa, which is why the idea of an active “Islamic World” includes only a relatively limited segment of sub-Saharan African Muslims."
"Whether they like it or not, the majority of sub-Saharan African Muslims are represented by states that are mostly secular, Christian, or dominated by other religions."
Africa’s Avoidable AIDS Crisi
"NEW YORK – At Uganda’s largest AIDS clinic, I recently witnessed a remarkable celebration of life."
"The performers were a troupe of young African singers, drummers and dancers, ranging in age from roughly eight to 28."
Rarely have I been so profoundly moved.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"“This is a land,” they sang,"
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
“Where beautiful people
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Laugh and dance in harmony.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Africa. O Africa.”
"And, indeed, these young people laughed and danced not only in harmony but with a joie de vivre that lit up their faces and filled us all with happiness."
"Listening, it was hard to imagine that they could easily be dead – and would be, if not for this clinic."
Each of those splendid performers is living with HIV.
Some arrived at the clinic so ill that they could scarcely walk.
"Others showed few symptoms but, having tested positive, came to be treated."
"They were mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, children and grandparents."
"All were alive and healthy for one reason only: the Joint Clinical Research Center in Kampala, and the drugs that it provides them."
Uganda was the epicenter of the AIDS epidemic.
There the scourge began in earnest; there (as elsewhere in Africa) it exacts its highest toll.
Yet Uganda is also a success story.
"A decade ago, fewer than 10,000 people were taking the new generation of antiretroviral drugs that suppress the disease and offer the promise of a normal life."
"Today, that figure is 200,000, thanks in large measure to generous support from the United States (under its PEPFAR program) and the Global Fund in Geneva."
We have seen similarly encouraging progress elsewhere.
"Botswana, among others, has invested heavily to offer universal treatment, and now is well on its way to ensuring that no baby is born with HIV – a reality in developed countries, but not so in Africa, where 400,000 children are born with the disease each year."
"South Africa, with the largest number of people living with HIV, has spent nearly $1 billion over the past year in an ambitious counseling and testing campaign to roll back the epidemic."
But there is a new and growing danger that these advances might not be sustained.
"Peter Mugyenyi, who runs the Joint Clinical Research Center, told me that part of the problem is the sheer weight of numbers."
"In Uganda, only about half of those with HIV/AIDS are being treated."
"Meanwhile, money for treatment is drying up."
"Because of the global recession, some international donors are threatening to cap their financial support."
"Countries such as Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Kenya, as well as Uganda, are requesting assistance for emergency drug supplies."
"In Kampala, Dr. Mugyenyi has begun placing new patients on a waiting list."
As many as seven million Africans who should be getting treatment for HIV are not.
"Worldwide, the number is about 10 million."
"Compounding the problem: donors have also been shifting their focus from AIDS to other diseases, because there is a sense that more lives can be saved more cheaply."
"At a time when we should be scaling up to meet the AIDS challenge, we are dialing back."
"In our global war on AIDS, the international community is on the verge of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory."
Those who rallied to the fight are alarmed.
They fear that the impressive gains of the last decade will be lost.
"“We are sitting on a time bomb,” Dr. Mugyenyi told me."
"Every day, he is forced into moral choices that no one should have to make."
How do you choose to treat a young girl but not her little brother?
"How do you turn away a pregnant mother, sitting with her children, crying for help?"
Surely we can do better.
"In Kampala, I promised my young friends that I would do everything I could to help."
"In Washington recently, the United Nations rolled out an action plan that should dramatically accelerate progress on maternal and child health, including HIV."
"At the International AIDS Conference in Vienna, in July, I hope that the international community will rally around UNAIDS’ launch of Treatment 2.0 — the next generation of HIV treatment, which must be more affordable, more effective, and accessible to all."
"As chair of this year’s replenishment of the Global Fund, I urge all donors to see to it that countries such as Uganda get the support they need, so that Dr. Mugyenyi and other front-line soldiers in the fight against AIDS need not make those difficult choices."
I left Uganda with a snatch of song that still echoes within my heart.
"Its inherent truth would be obvious, had you been there to see:&#160;"
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
We are still useful.
"&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; To our countries, to our families."
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"All we need is a way to live our days,"
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All we need is to survive in Africa.
"Yes, times are hard."
That is all the more reason to act out of compassion and with generosity.
Africa\u0027s \
"I visited Ghana recently and like many others left asking: how can a ""developing"" country be developed?"
"But there was something troubling about this formulation, in particular with the word ""developing,"" which is often a euphemism for the absence of economic development."
Do countries stop developing because outsiders are so intent on developing them?
"My hosts, the Kweku Hutchful Foundation, invited me with a different question in mind: How can Ghanaian leaders be developed?"
"Something troubled me about this formulation, too."
"It was that word ""development"" again."
"Do we really ""develop"" leaders or countries?"
"Do multinational companies, international non-governmental organizations, and multilateral lenders really understand local needs?"
"Just because some ""best practice"" works in New York, does that mean it will work in Accra, Ghana?"
"Imagine how American managers would react to consultants arriving from Ghana with their ""best practice"": ""It worked in Accra, so it is bound to work in New York!"""
"Of course, there is a prominent example of just that: Kofi Annan, under whose stewardship the UN has undergone a remarkable improvement."
"Annan spent most of his career outside of Ghana, and had some of his higher education in the US. But, as one of Annan's advisors once put it, he ""runs the UN like an old-fashioned African village, with long discussions among the elders, periods of reflection, and eventually a decision."""
"Of course, Annan can hardly control the UN by imposing great strategies on everyone else, as American corporate CEOs do. But perhaps he knows better."
"Unlike most American CEOs, Annan was not parachuted in from outside; he is the first career employee to lead the UN."
"So he knew what was wrong and appreciated that it had to be fixed carefully and patiently, by engaging the staff rather than intimidating them."
"His re-election to a second term as UN Secretary General was supported by nations all over the world, rich and poor, as well as by UN employees."
"Was Kofi Annan ""developed?"""
Perhaps we don't develop leaders so much as foster the conditions that bring out leadership.
"If so, then a key condition must be the self-respect that comes from working things out for ourselves, individually and collectively."
"This self-respect is fostered by organizations and institutions that can likewise stand on their own feet, building on the best of their own cultural traditions."
"Passive importation of techniques, controls, and beliefs, via agencies and experts that run around solving everyone else's problems, may be the biggest impediment to development--just another form of outside exploitation, of which Africa has had more than enough."
"Is it not time for indigenous development, of countries and leaders alike?"
One thing is clear. Countries like Ghana do not lack enterprise.
Markets and personal initiative are pervasive.
"At a red light in New York, a squeegee kid or two might approach your car; in Accra, a stopped car is immediately surrounded by a virtual supermarket."
"What Ghana and most of Africa lacks is not enterprise, but"
"Instead, foreign corporations, with their funds, controls, and experts--and, just as importantly, their beliefs--dominate larger enterprise."
"To be sure, foreign corporations can do good things: bring in fresh ideas, techniques, and processes, as well as capital and the scale required in some contemporary forms of manufacturing. But nothing they do--aside from cosmetic modifications to consumer products and marketing tactics--responds to local conditions."
"Development as now practiced often fails because it does not build on a country's unique strengths, respect its social traditions, or foster the autonomy necessary to develop indigenous leaders and enterprises."
"All too often, it i"
"Pride, dignity, and self-confidence do not figure in economic theory: they cannot be measured."
"But they figure prominently in just about every story of success, whether of countries or of leaders."
"How people feel about themselves, personally and collectively, greatly influences the energy with which they develop themselves."
"America, for example, did not develop by depending on an imposed ideology or outside experts."
"It developed through the indigenous efforts of Americans acting in their own way--assisted by extensive state intervention, through land grants to farmers, railroads, and mining companies, military spending that stimulated the economy (and still does), and, of course, tariff barriers."
"Likewise, indigenous development played a key role in Japan and Germany after WWII, in South Korea more recently, and the UK long before."
"In fact, ha"
Globalization must not be allowed to blind us.
"Ghana certainly needs to develop economically, because material wealth is required to improve health, provide education, and sustain democracy. But the reverse is also true: a deep-rooted sense of democracy--precisely what globalization lacks--seems necessary to support economic efforts."
The (economically) developed West should consider importing that lesson.
Africa’s Bitter Harvest
"Souley Madi is one of the most productive cotton growers in the Badjengo Cameroon, an area where the lush forests of central Africa give way to the semi-arid Sahel."
"Thanks to a combination of intense heat and periodic Sahelian rains, Madi consistently produces clean, high-quality cotton on the gently sloping hills that surround his walled compound."
"But, as the next growing season approaches, Madi, who is 40, faces a difficult decision: how much cotton should he grow this year?"
Prices for cotton were so low last year that Madi cut his acreage.
"He earned less from cotton last year than the year before, and much less than he earned five years ago."
"“I’m angry, but what can I do?” he asks."
"This year Madi may grow even less cotton, even though the crop is the main source of income for himself, his two wives and his five children."
"On some of his land, he now grows corn and peanuts instead of cotton."
"But cotton potentially offers the best payback, because it has cash value on the international market and can be stored for long periods of time."
"Like millions of other African cotton farmers, Madi has advantages over cotton farmers in other parts of the world."
"His land costs are low. So are his labor costs, since he relies on family and friends to weed and pick the crop."
"Nor does he needs expensive machinery to plant his seeds; his plow is drawn by cattle, and he pushes seeds into the ground with his bare hands."
"A state-owned cotton company collects his cotton relatively efficiently, gins it nearby to produce lint and then sells the lint on the international market, generally paying Madi promptly and fairly."
"Madi’s earnings help him keep his children in school, even at the height of the cotton harvest."
"Having attended secondary school himself, he believes that his children will better their lives through education."
He knows his children’s future depends on better prices for cotton.
"But forces beyond Madi’s control – even beyond his awareness – are restraining cotton prices, creating a global glut that is largely the result of policies followed by the world’s richest governments."
"The United States government pays billions of dollars to cotton growers, mainly in California, Texas, and Mississippi."
"The European Union also contributes to low cotton prices, paying farmers in Greece about $1 billion a year to grow the crop at a loss."
"Such subsidies are a global scandal, yet large payments to largely wealthy American and Greek cotton growers seem likely to persist for many years."
"The best chance to end cotton subsidies soon was lost last December, when African countries, aided by India and Brazil, pressed hard for the elimination of cotton subsidies, at the World Trade Organization’s meeting in Hong Kong."
"The US and Europe offered only a token reduction, scotching a deal."
The only chance to end cotton subsidies is now somehow to convince US and EU leaders to assist African peasants by curtailing payments to their own cotton farmers.
A revision to what Americans call “the farm program” is scheduled for next year.
"The powerful US cotton lobby wants no change in the level of payments, however."
"European farmers also want to maintain current subsidy levels, and EU members say that they are unlikely to make any reductions before the end of the decade."
"Take away subsidies and cotton prices will rise, perhaps as much as 15%."
"“There’s real money here for the individual African,” says Daniel Sumner, an economist and cotton expert at the University of California."
"Trade officials in both the US and Europe say that they will no longer encourage farmers to overproduce, and that they will end programs that specifically subsidize exports."
"For Africans, however, these changes are cosmetic, doing little or nothing to lift cotton prices."
Africans are trying to make the best out of a bad situation.
"In some parts of Africa, cotton growers are expanding production, providing proof that if the US and Europe did somehow curtail their own cotton output, Africans could plug the gap."
"In Uganda, where civil wars in the 1970’s and 1980’s devastated farming, cotton growers are making a major comeback."
"In Zambia, cotton output is soaring."
"In both countries, foreign investors are opening gins and assisting growers."
"In Cameroon, where cotton is the main source of income for nearly five million people, record crops were posted last year and the year before."
"“Our farmers are dedicated and disciplined, committed to quality,” says Ali Batour, a manager with Cameroon’s Sodecoton, the state-owned marketer."
“They deserve a fair price.”
"But Souley Madi is resigned to receiving unfair cotton prices, perhaps for a long time."
"During the last harvest, when 100-degree heat forced him, his wives, and his mother to stop picking cotton after a few hours, he returned to his compound to tend to his ducks."
He recently started raising a flock and last Christmas earned the equivalent of $70 on the sale of 18 birds.
"Tapping his forehead, Madi insists, “We are waiting for the situation to change.”"
"For how long, he says, “depends on God.”"
Africa\u0027s Debt Dilemma
"The success that US President George W. Bush and his special envoy, former Secretary of State James Baker, had in getting Iraq's foreign debts canceled or rescheduled shows what can be done when a policy is backed by political will."
The contrast with Africa's debts could hardly be starker.
"Just three years ago, Jubilee 2000 made news when civil society groups, rock stars, and a few finance ministers like Britain's Gordon Brown pushed for African debt cancellation."
President Bush mostly succeeded in his crusade; Jubilee 2000 succeeded mostly in getting empty promises.
"Of course, the two campaigns confronted different obstacles and had different bases of support."
Baker's mission possessed the unlimited backing of a US faced with the gargantuan cost of reconstructing Iraq; Jubilee 2000 had only world opinion behind it.
Lucrative reconstruction contracts in Iraq gave America leverage to coerce its allies into submission; Jubilee 2000 had no such weapon of persuasion.
"Finally, Baker was appealing to America's traditional allies in Europe and the Middle East, who need American friendship in many areas."
"The campaign to forgive Africa's debt was, on the other hand, focused on the crushing debt load owed by African countries to the IMF and the World Bank, who only have money to worry about."
"Still, the Jubilee campaign's street protests began a healthy debate about the lending arrangements of the IMF/World Bank."
But the time has come to abandon the Jubilee movement's humanitarian approach and focus instead on the legal aspect.
"It is worth remembering that no sub-Saharan African country - with the exceptions of South Africa and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), then administered by white minority governments - could tap international capital markets at independence in the early 1960's."
Domestic capital markets were non-existent.
"As a result, these countries were left with no choice but to subcontract their development to the IMF and World Bank."
"These institutions identified, appraised, approved, and financed projects that ratcheted up African debt."
"They monitored and sanctioned the recruitment of consultants that conducted the studies related to these projects, as well as the expatriate staff involved in their execution."
"During the period of implementation, they carried out regular supervisory missions supplemented by quarterly progress reports and annual audits."
"Still, despite all these costly measures paid for by Africans, all the post-evaluation reports on completed projects indicated that the overwhelming majority of projects were unable to generate the revenues needed to service the debts that financed them."
"But the debtor countries are nonetheless obliged to service these debts by whatever means necessary, including more borrowing and further entanglement, leading to further impoverishment."
"For example, per capita growth between 1965 and 1998"
What went wrong?
The multilateral lenders advocated a development strategy based on the theory of comparative advantage and unbridled economic liberalization.
"Africa had to open its markets while producing raw materials and basic products to generate revenues for investment in industry, education, health, and food production."
"These assumptions turned out to be wrong, as export prices fell steadily over four decades."
But it should have been obvious from the outset that the IMF/World Bank strategy was doomed to fail.
All developed nations protected and subsidized their domestic production in the first phases of their development - and still do whenever it suits them.
"Furthermore the US, the EU member states and the East Asian countries all regulated inward foreign investment and imposed capital controls."
"Partnerships with foreign companies were designed to allow local businesses to benefit from technology transfer and training, while creating the most favorable conditions for local producers to add value to domestic production and exports."
"In the face of these undeniable facts, the path chosen by the IMF and the World Bank was, at best, a mark of their incompetence and, at worst, a deliberate ploy to keep the sub-Saharan countries and their populations in bondage."
"Whatever the case, both institutions certainly have much to answer for - and the loan agreements provide an arbitration clause to bring them to account."
"These clauses have yet to be invoked, but for the sake of unity and to strengthen the solidarity of African countries, it would be advisable for the nascent African Union take the lead."
"The AU should seek legal advice, have the issue included on the agenda of the UN General Assembly, advocate the freezing of international debt payments while arbitration proceedings are taking place and secure the support of the international community, especially NGOs that have a track record in raising awareness about Africa's debts."
"Any compensation retrieved from such legal proceedings should be used to establish an African monetary fund whose objective would be to put Africa on a fast track to comprehensive regional integration, enabling the continent to capitalize on globalization's positive features."
Litigation can be costly and hazardous.
"However, set against the alternative of relying on handouts punctuated by desperation and frequent episodes of collective self-destruction, Africa should choose the legal option to rally its people and rescue its development process."
Africa’s Diaspora to the Rescue
"DAKAR – There is something dismally familiar about the tide of news reports concerning Africa’s increased suffering – more poverty, malnutrition, civil strife, and death – in the face of the recent global financial crisis."
"Almost everywhere, the media translates academic conclusions into graphic illustrations of brutality and despair in places such as Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"But there is another, woefully under-reported, side to the story."
"African countries that were locked out of international capital markets for most of the past five decades have largely been spared the twin woes of financial turmoil and economic downturn. The continent’s economies experienced a slowdown, but not a recession."
"Indeed, according to McKinsey &amp;"
"Company, Africa was the third-largest contributor to world economic growth in 2009, after China and India."
"Moreover, several African countries have received ratings from credit agencies, which has opened up global financial centers to them."
"In some cases, these ratings have proved equivalent to or higher than those of countries such as Turkey or Argentina."
Stock exchanges are being established across the continent.
"Furthermore, countries such as China, India, and Brazil has provided a platform for increased exports and the inception of a model of cooperation based on trade, investment, and technology transfer, rather than “aid.”"
"China-Africa trade alone increased from $10 billion in 2000 to $107 billion in 2008, and billions of dollars are being invested in oil production, mining, transportation, electricity generation and transmission, telecommunications, and other infrastructure."
These developments have combined to improve African countries’ macroeconomic performance dramatically.
"Inflation has been halved since the 1990’s, and foreign-exchange reserves have increased 30%."
"Public finances showed a 2.8%-of-GDP surplus in 2008, compared to a 1.4%-of-GDP deficit in 2000-2005."
"Savings rates are between 10% and 20%, and external debt has decreased from 110% of GDP in 2005 to 21% in 2008."
"Since 2000, sub-Saharan African countries have achieved economic growth of 5-7%."
Many factors have contributed to this upturn.
Emerging-market demand has pushed up commodity prices.
Urbanization has given rise to a dynamic informal sector.
"Improved governance, higher food production, increased inter-regional trade, debt cancellation, better use of official development assistance (ODA), and thriving telecommunications and housing markets have helped as well."
But transfers from the African diaspora stand out as the most significant contributing factor.
A study commissioned by the Rome-based International Fund for Agricultural Development indicates that more than 30 million individuals living outside their countries of origin contribute more than $40 billion annually in remittances to their families and communities back home.
"For sub-Saharan African countries, remittances increased from $3.1 billion in 1995 to $18.5 billion in 2007, according to the World Bank, representing between 9% and 24% of GDP and 80-750% of ODA."
"Migrants’ remittance behavior is essentially dictated by the regulatory environment and the quality – in terms of speed, cost, security, and accessibility – of products and services offered by banks, money-transfer companies, micro-finance institutions, and informal operators."
"In this respect, there are three different strategies in place in Africa."
"The Anglophone strategy focuses on freeing up the remittance market by encouraging competition, relaxing regulatory constraints for non-bank operators, offering financial incentives, encouraging technical and financial innovation, and stimulating collaboration among market players."
"This approach, also adopted by Italy, contributes to reducing costs and increasing the overall volume of funds for beneficiaries."
"The Hispanic approach emphasizes migrants’ involvement in banking by offering a range of banking services in both the country of origin and the host country, products of specific interest to migrants, and low commissions on foreign transfers."
"This approach, widely developed by Morocco and the Portuguese-speaking world, is epitomized by the zero-commission policy initiated by the Spanish bank Santander and its Moroccan counterpart, Attijariwafa Bank."
"Finally, the Francophone approach relies on two types of monopoly."
"The first is enjoyed by Western Union, which controls up to 90% of the total formal transfer volume within Africa’s 16-member Franc Zone."
"Western Union charges fees as high as 25% on transfers to these countries, compared to an average global benchmark of 5%, and has required that Franc-Zone countries sign exclusivity agreements, thereby preventing foreign-exchange bureaux, post offices, and micro-finance institutions from carrying out money transfers."
The second monopoly is exercised in the banking sector.
"France has a veto within the boards of directors of the Franc Zone’s two central banks, while two French commercial banks, BNP-Paribas and Société Générale, exercise a quasi-monopoly on lending programs, mainly centered on short-term trade financing and the needs of governments, public and private companies, and the elite."
"All other local banks have adopted the same approach, severely restricting access to financial services for households and entrepreneurs."
"Despite the increasing importance of remittances from Italy, Spain, and the United States, the largest share in absolute terms still originates from France."
"There is thus a real need in the Franc Zone for a financing institution that would convert migrant remittances into productive investments, thereby generating jobs and wealth, and that would broaden access to banking services, mortgages, insurance products, pension plans, and technical assistance."
"Official statistics for 2009 are likely to show that migrants’ remittances fell sharply, as the global recession severely eroded job opportunities abroad. That makes it all the more important that African countries, many of which have laid a strong groundwork for sustainable growth, have a financial system in place that can leverage remittances effectively as the global economy recovers."
Africa’s Dictator-Diplomat
BRUSSELS – The recent death in Brussels of Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi finally brings to light what lay behind his mysterious two-month disappearance from public life.
Ethiopia’s government had strenuously denied rumors of serious ill health caused by liver cancer.
"Now that the worst has, indeed, proven true, Ethiopia and all of East Africa will need to learn to live without the stabilizing influence of its great dictator-diplomat."
Meles was certainly both.
"Ethiopia has undergone a remarkable transformation under his strongman rule since 1991, when his Tigrayan minority group from the country’s north came to power with the overthrow of the odious Communist Derg led by Mengistu Haile Mariam (still enjoying a comfortable retirement in Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe)."
"Initially serving as the president of the first post-Derg government, and then as Ethiopia’s prime minister from 1995 until his death, Meles (his nom de guerre in the revolution) oversaw 7.7% annual GDP growth in recent years."
"Strong economic performance is somewhat surprising, given his party’s interventionist policy approach, but Meles showed himself to be a consummate pragmatist in attracting investment – particularly from China – to drive growth."
Meles’s own political provenance as the leader of the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front was Marxist-Leninist.
"But, when the Cold War ended, so, too, did his dogmatism."
"To his credit, child mortality was reduced by 40% under his government; Ethiopia’s economy became more diversified, with new industries like car manufacturing, beverages, and floriculture; and major infrastructure projects, including Africa’s largest hydroelectric dam, were launched."
"Once a basket-case associated in the world’s eyes only with famine and drought, Ethiopia has become one of Africa’s largest economies – and without the benefit of gold or oil."
Perhaps more important than Meles’s domestic achievements was his diplomatic record.
"He was an indispensable ally of the West in the fight against Islamist terrorism, culminating in Ethiopia’s military operation in neighboring Somalia in 2006."
"More recently, Meles coordinated efforts with Kenya to stage limited strikes against the al-Shabaab militia, which has waged an unrelenting war to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic theocracy."
"At the same time, Meles courted China as both an investor and as a hedge against the West’s criticism of his human-rights record."
"And yet he controversially but rightly held out a hand of friendship to the breakaway region of Somaliland, before it became fashionable, and went as far as he could short of formal re-recognition of that ray of democratic hope in the Horn of Africa."
"Meles will be sorely missed in Hargeisa, as he planned to run a Chinese-financed gas pipeline through Somaliland territory from the Ogaden to the coast."
"More important, Meles put Addis Ababa on the map as the home of the African Union, and as a capital where Africa’s worst problems could be discussed in a pragmatic manner, unburdened by colonial grudges."
"Meles himself became a major diplomatic player, particularly over climate-change policy, and most recently was active in mediating border and natural-resource disputes between Sudan and the newly independent (and oil-rich) South Sudan."
"He will be remembered for accepting the painful secession of Eritrea in 1993, rather than prolong the civil war, and for his efforts to reach an agreement with Egypt over the use of the Blue Nile waters."
The great stain on Meles’s record will always be his intolerance of dissent.
"To be sure, his human-rights record was far better than the Derg’s."
"For example, he allowed a private press to flourish, and in 2000 he became the first Ethiopian leader to hold multi-party parliamentary elections."
"Moreover, compared to neighboring Eritrea under President Isaias Afewerki or Omar al-Bashir’s Sudan, his regime was by no means the worst offender in the region."
Nor was there much evidence of personal enrichment or widespread corruption.
"Nevertheless, following a violently contested parliamentary election in 2005, in which more than 30 parties participated, Meles demonstrated open contempt for democratic pluralism and press freedom, jailing several journalists in recent years."
"At the same time, he imposed increasingly strict central control on his ethnically and linguistically diverse country."
"Although nominally governed by “ethnic federalism,” where this threatened secession, as in Oromia or the Ogaden, Meles was quick to ignore the constitutional set-up."
"Although he strengthened religious freedom and peaceful coexistence between Muslims and Christians, the human-rights situation in Ethiopia remained poor."
"For example, groups like Freedom House and Human Rights Watch have documented widespread official repression of the Oromo people."
"And yet Meles is irreplaceable – unmatched intellectually as an African leader (he dropped out of medical school, but went on to teach himself impeccable English and obtain European university degrees by correspondence), and unmatched politically at home, with no obvious successor groomed to replace him."
"In the Horn of Africa, there is no leader of his stature who could ensure the stability and strong governance that the region so desperately needs."
"Hailemariam Desalegn, Meles’s foreign minister, will take over Ethiopia’s government."
But there will be considerable concern in the West about the danger of a power vacuum or struggle in a geopolitically vital but fractious country –&nbsp;and just when neighboring Somalia is supposed to be undergoing a transition to a new parliament and elected government.
"For his admirers and critics alike, Meles leaves behind a potent political legacy."
"He will be remembered as an African leader of major historical significance: visionary, despotic, and indispensable."
Africa’s Economic House Divided
DAKAR – The world economic downturn and financial-market tremors have strained budgets across Africa.
"With the exception of Ghana, and a few other states, in 2009 most African countries’ fiscal balances deteriorated."
"But, thanks to prudent management of public finances during previous periods of robust growth, a significant number of African countries have endured the current crisis in better fiscal shape than during past crises."
"In 2009, aggregate GDP growth in Africa averaged 1.6%, down from about 5.7% during the 2002-2008 period – but growth all the same."
"Moreover, several African countries continued to implement long-term reforms to improve their business and investment climate, despite the daunting challenges presented by the crisis."
"Now that international trade and global industrial production are on the mend, sub-Saharan economies look set for more robust growth, as demand for and prices of oil and other minerals rebound and general economic activity resumes."
"Of course, numerous downside risks – adverse weather shocks, military conflict, and political turmoil – still can undermine the hard-earned benefits of this social and economic record."
But it is the dichotomized nature of their economies and finances that represents Africa’s most intractable structural imbalance.
"Frankly, two Africa’s are emerging: a modern economy and a cash-based economy."
"Across Africa, almost all governments praise – some honestly, some not – economic modernization as the cornerstone of prosperity and the yardstick by which their effectiveness should be measured. Many boast of the modernity of the financial infrastructure of their economies, which is based on an entire set of legal, regulatory, accounting, credit reporting, and payment and settlement systems."
National payment systems operate electronic-based payment products and services.
"A high-value inter-bank funds-transfer system settles transactions in real time, eliminates credit risk between system participants, increases circulation of funds, and enhances monetary-policy implementation."
Banks are provided with a facility to monitor their positions in real time and hence make cost-effective investment decisions.
"So far, only a few registered financial institutions, primarily offshoots of Western commercial banks, have access to such payment-system facilities."
"Non-banking financial institutions such as foreign exchange bureaus, post offices, and micro-finance lenders are not admitted, even when they are financially sound and sustainable."
The effects of banks’ hijacking of national payment systems to service only the modern economy are compounded by the exclusive agreements that banks and money-transfer companies such as Western Union have signed with most African countries.
"These agreements lock out non-banking entities from the highly lucrative market for migrant remittances from the African diaspora, which remain a key engine of growth."
Yet rapid urbanization everywhere in Africa has given rise to a dynamic informal sector unconnected to the modern economy.
"Although marginalized by African officials, this cash-based economy is a major contributor to the continent’s productive capacity."
It employs more than 90% of the workforce and is home to 75% of the retailers.
"But, despite the pivotal economic role that the informal sector plays, it has no access to conventional bank loans."
Micro-finance institutions provide the only credit lines open to informal operators.
The micro-finance business model is based on lending that is guaranteed by the group.
"This translates into a solidarity network and a support mechanism that mitigates credit risk and encourages payment discipline. Credit repayment in well-managed micro-finance institutions is around 95%. All studies undertaken in the area have also revealed that women are not only the most active among informal-sector entrepreneurs, but they are also quicker to meet their commitments."
African states must now recognize that modernizing their informal sectors by integrating them into the modern economy can be a major development tool. Yet only a few countries have started moving in that direction.
"Nigeria has refrained from signing any exclusive agreements with Western Union and others, and its newly consolidated banking industry is making significant inroads across the region."
"Rwanda, too, has enacted regulations that eliminate exclusive agreements, opening doors for micro-finance institutions to become payment-service providers."
The South African Reserve Bank has created a special platform within its national payment system for micro-finance institutions and non-banks.
"Malawi’s national payments system is directly accessible to non-bank participants, including third-party service providers."
Giving micro-finance institutions access to national and regional payments systems and electronic retail facilities will go a long way toward meeting the requirements of the retail and business sector in terms of banking facilities.
"It will also help facilitate access by the poorest to financial services, thus helping to reduce the high proportion of the un-banked population."
All of this will invariably spur development and integration of national financial systems and intra-regional trade.
"This will be a welcome development, because a large proportion of intra-regional trade is carried out by informal operators and small and medium enterprises that do not have access to the banking system."
"Moreover, economic integration and increased intra-regional trade are the best entry point into global markets for all countries."
"When it comes to analyzing what ails Africa, it is customary to dwell at length on the continent’s traumatic past."
"But it strains the imagination to link Africa’s colonial-era pains with the willingness of African leaders to spend a fortune to equip their countries with state-of-the-art settlement systems, and then proceed to exclude their citizens from using them."
Abraham Lincoln once said that a house divided cannot stand.
There is an economic corollary to this: an economic house divided cannot prosper.
Africa’s Hard Black Gold
LAGOS - Few infrastructure services in the developed world may be as taken for granted as electric power.
"To consumers in industrialized countries, uninterrupted power supply is a given."
"Not so in much of Africa, which experiences some of the world’s greatest power deficits, and where only two in ten people have access to electricity."
"According to the International Monetary Fund’s most recent Regional Economic Outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa , in 2007 alone, nearly two-thirds of the countries in the region experienced an acute energy crisis marked by frequent and extended electricity outages."
There is no shortage of hydropower plants for electricity generation in Africa.
"However, many of these plants are unable to keep up with rapid population growth and attendant increases in demand."
"Furthermore, they are prone to frequent drought, which reduces their output significantly, leaving many as little more than decorative infrastructure landmarks."
Increasingly burgeoning populations in countries like Nigeria and Ghana imply a greater extraction of water resources for power generation.
Rapid expansion of agricultural activity is requiring more and more water all across the continent.
"Other resources like fuel oil, diesel, light crude, solar, and gas are also available as means of electricity generation, but their costs are all quite prohibitive."
These factors make a good argument for coal as a cheap alternative source of Africa's power.
"Coal has historically played a crucial role as a source of energy worldwide, and has several important advantages over other fossil fuels. First is its relative abundance."
The current level of proven coal reserves worldwide stands at roughly 850 billion tons.
Africa has about 50 billion tons.
Coal is also much more widely distributed geographically than any other fossil fuel.
"Worldwide energy demand has increased by more than 50% since 1980, and is expected to grow annually by 1.6% between now and 2030."
"More than 70% of this new demand will come from developing countries, with fossil fuels projected to account for about 80% of total energy demand by the end of this period."
"Coal is the world’s fastest growing fossil fuel, with annual production increasing by 6.4% since 2004."
It is already the dominant source of power generation in some very important energy-consuming nations.
Much of the future increases in coal-fired electricity generation will come from strategically important developing countries like China and India.
"In 2006 alone, China added about 93,000 megawatts of coal- fired electricity generating capacity, and this trend is expected to continue as the country tries to meet its huge energy needs."
"Even in many developed countries, coal still accounts for a large share of power generation."
Coal plants currently provide more than half of America’s electricity supply.
"Denmark, which houses some of the most efficient coal-fired power plants in the world, equally relies on coal for half of its electricity production."
"The same is true for Germany, which is home to some of the most efficient pulverized coal combustion units in Europe."
"Poland uses coal for 98% of its electricity production, and South Africa uses coal for about 50% of its electricity production."
"Against this picture then, it is hard not to expect developing countries to exploit their abundant coal resources to generate power for their own development, especially given that modern technology can help produce coal cleanly."
"Some argue that gas might be a better alternative to hydro or coal, but for countries that must import much of their gas the benefits of a stable and reliable source of cheap fuel in the form of coal present a very strong counter-argument to the capital costs of a gas plant."
"Unlike prices for coal, which is abundant and dispersed geographically, gas prices are subject to significant volatility, and the long-term trend in the face of fossil fuel depletion is uncertain."
"In contrast, coal prices are more stable, and may remain that way for a long time."
"Apart from electric-power generation, coal also has wide application in a number of industries."
It is pivotal in both steel and cement production.
"Moreover, the use of wood by Africa’s growing population is causing increasingly rapid deforestation in many countries."
"There is significant potential domestic demand for coal briquettes to replace wood for cooking and domestic and industrial heating. The demand outlook thus appears favorable for the coal industry, creating significant investment opportunities."
"Clearly, there are environmental drawbacks from the use of coal as an energy resource, and these concerns are far too important to overlook."
"The massive reserves notwithstanding, coal is still a finite resource."
It must be mined with greater efficiency and with a view to mitigating the environmental impact.
"Fortunately, much greater attention is paid today to mine safety and the management of the by-products of coal use."
"With acid rain and other public-health hazards linked to coal combustion, more technologies are emerging for reducing harmful emissions from power plants."
"Fueled by research, the past few years have witnessed the development of increasingly cleaner and more energy-efficient coal-fired generation plants and the retirement of older technologies, especially in the developed world."
"Developing countries have lagged behind in this process, but, with the common threat of global warming, there is now growing pressure to adopt conservation policies."
Africa's mineral-rich countries must exploit their abundant natural resources.
They must use coal to advance their economic development.
Failure to do so would be a missed opportunity at a time when African countries must avail themselves of all available resources for poverty reduction.
Africa’s Immunity
ACCRA – The United States suffers rising job losses.
Britain nationalizes its banks.
"Once high-flying small economies like Ireland, Hungary, and Iceland break down."
"Even robust China and India are experiencing slower growth, curtailed ambitions, and broken dreams."
"Yet, in sub-Saharan Africa, there are few hints of the global financial crisis that is consuming the capitalist world."
"In fashionable African cities, residential home prices remain stratospheric."
"A typical Western-style house in Kampala or Accra, for example, now costs an astonishing two to three times the price of a comparable home in, say, Cleveland or other cities in the American heartland."
"While home prices are crashing from Madrid to Dublin and Miami to Los Angeles, African prices remain near or at record-high levels."
"African banks, meanwhile, are rock-solid compared to their debt-heavy counterparts in the US and Europe."
"While international bankers went bust by making legions of bad loans, African bankers stuck to earning profits the old-fashioned way: paying very little to depositors, and earning a big “spread” by buying guaranteed government debt, which yielded healthy returns."
Even government deficit spending – long the bane of Africa – seems positively puny compared to the massive debts that the US and some European countries face.
The new Obama administration is proposing spending plans that would create a record US deficit of more than one trillion dollars – and this coming on top of the outgoing Bush administration’s record deficit.
And yet there are good reasons to believe that it is just a matter of time before Africa and its peoples experience the ill effects of the global crisis.
"From Ghana to Kenya, governments are having increased difficulty in raising money for infrastructure projects and selling official debt."
"Foreign investment in sub-Saharan Africa, which reached record levels in recent years, is retreating, which is evidence of investor caution, not any underlying lack of optimism about the region."
"And exports of raw materials to China, India, Europe, and the US – a key factor in Africa’s recent growth surge – may suffer simply because the global slowdown means less consumption everywhere."
All of these factors suggest that an African financial bust is possible.
"Popular equity investments, such as shares in Safaricom, are already trading at unexpectedly low levels."
"If real estate prices were to fall dramatically, a chain reaction could occur, taking down big and small investors alike, and over time causing wide suffering to ordinary Africans."
"Even assuming stability in real estate prices, the global crisis surely will cause a fall in remittances by Africans working good jobs in Europe, the US, Canada, Australia, and the Middle East."
"Remittances are already believed to be falling, which makes sense: immigrants in rich countries are and will be disproportionately hurt by slowing economic activity."
"Immigration itself may even slow dramatically, depending on the length and depth of the economic slowdown."
Fewer Africans working in rich countries will automatically translate into less money circulating in African countries.
"The decline in remittances, however, cuts both ways."
Remittances have long spurred inflation in many parts of Africa.
"A Ugandan doctor working in Norway, for instance, cares little about the cost of a beer in Kampala."
"He is also willing – and able – to pay more than a local doctor for services and, of course, a home in Uganda."
Fewer remittances flowing into Uganda could mean less economic activity – or simply lower prices.
"The financial meltdown in the US, which incubated the global crisis, is either coming under control or threatening to mutate into a new, more virulent form that could destroy not only America’s paper economy of trading and brokering, but also its real economy of goods and services."
"President Barack Obama, acting as if the latter scenario remains likely, is betting on large-scale government spending to prop up the real economy."
"If his administration succeeds, the chances that Africa will remain relatively unscathed will grow."
"Even if Obama fails, however, Africans should escape the worst of the global crisis, for both good reasons and bad."
The good reasons have to do with African self-reliance and a growing awareness among scholars and policymakers that trade within the region – especially between urban and rural Africa – will ultimately deliver enormous benefits.
Another factor working in Africa’s favor is its private companies’ and consumers’ low dependence on borrowed money.
"People tend to pay cash for goods and services, however costly."
"In the US, loans for cars and homes – loans that now aren’t being paid back – are the major factor behind the financial crisis."
"In Africa, very few people borrow money for such purchases."
Africa’s cash-based economy has in the past constrained development.
"After all, by allowing people to spend more than they have, borrowed money can fuel growth."
"But today, Africa’s pay-as-you-go practices are a powerful defense against financial contagion."
Another way of looking at Africa’s paradoxical economic position is to admit that the region’s historical marginalization within the international financial system – so costly in times of global plenty – is proving to be an unexpected benefit when the wealthiest of the world are sick unto death.
Africa’s Integration Imperative
Karl Marx predicted that states would wither away in anticipation of an idyllic communist society capable of auto-regulating economic imbalances and empowering the masses.
"So he would have been flabbergasted to see his prophecy realized, not by communism, but by the globalization of Anglo-American economic liberalism."
"Opening up markets to the free flow of capital, not the dictatorship of the proletariat, has rendered state power obsolete."
"Today’s capital markets raise money for governments, corporate clients, and individual customers, manage pension funds’ investments, and bet on the level of interest rates or the stock market."
"Trading in derivatives by investment banks, hedge funds, and other market participants, reaps huge profits for traders while depriving the real economy of productive investment and job creation."
No population in the world is spared from the harsh treatment of such a system.
"Some 40% of the world’s 6.5 billion people live in poverty, and a sixth live in extreme poverty."
"However, the world’s black populations are the prime victims."
"In the United States, one-eighth of all black males between the ages of 25 and 34 are in jail, and three out of five black American households with children are headed by a single mother."
"As for African countries, the politics and economics of globalization have stripped them of their assets and natural resources and left them with an unbearable debt burden."
"As a result, the percentage of Africa’s population living in extreme poverty increased from 41.6% in 1981 to 46.9% in 2001."
"On the other hand, in the era of globalization, regions in which internal trade exceeds external trade have better economic outlooks and stronger social cohesion."
"This is the case for Europe, Asia, and, increasingly, Latin America, particularly among the member states of Mercosur (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and Paraguay)."
The opposite is true for regional groupings in Africa and in the Middle East where trade with the outside world is more important than intra-regional trade.
"As a result, any country formulating strategies to counter the destructive forces of globalization should give overriding priority to a self-centred economic development strategy, preferably within a regional framework."
This is a prerequisite to defending against market fundamentalism and avoiding the iniquitous conditions of the international marketplace.
"In this respect, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) constitutes an edifying example."
The ASEAN economies adopted a united front on international economic issues and accorded priority to internal economic integration and expanding linkages with major trading partners.
"Exports have remained the main driver of economic performance for the ASEAN countries, contributing to 5.8% regional GDP growth in 2006."
"ASEAN foreign direct investment (FDI) flows reached US$38 billion in 2005, up by 48% from the previous year."
"The outlook for 2006 was also bullish, with preliminary data for the first quarter indicating that FDI flows had already reached US$14 billion, up from US$7.4 billion in the year-earlier period."
ASEAN’s drive to establish a fully-fledged economic community has been underlined by implementation of its Priority Integration Sector Roadmaps.
"By contrast, sub-Saharan Africa’s historical legacy of artificial and unmanageable colonial boundaries, ethnic antagonisms, its citizens’ deficit of self-respect, and an appalling record of leadership failures has hampered its quest for economic integration."
"But a sector-by-sector approach could mitigate these handicaps, and, given the pressing need to address demand for energy and climate change, it might be strategically advisable to start with the energy sector."
"Africa is a continent rich in energy, holding two-thirds of the world’s reserves of hydro-electric power – trillions of kilowatt-hours representing about half of total world resources."
The Congo River alone holds more than 600 billion kilowatt-hours of annual reserves. The Sanaga (Cameroon) and the Ogooué (Gabon) hold half as much.
"Technological breakthroughs have made it feasible to transport electricity via high-voltage direct current (HVDC) over long distances without incurring great losses (only about 3% per 1,000 kilometers)."
Carbon-free hydroelectric power is the right choice as sub-Saharan Africa’s principal source of energy.
"Harnessing the hydroelectric power of the Congo Basin alone would be enough to meet all of Africa’s energy needs, or to light the entire continent of South America. Moreover, establishing an African grid would enable power from the Democratic Republic of Congo to be delivered to southern European countries such as Spain, Portugal, and Italy."
"However, while 90% of world reserves of hydraulic energy are concentrated in underdeveloped regions like sub-Saharan Africa, HVDC technology remains the preserve of developed countries."
"There is thus an imperative not only for regional integration in Africa, but also for a joint strategic vision and partnership to help build global energy and climate security."
Africa’s Last Famine
"WASHINGTON, DC – Last year, the international community recognized one of the worst humanitarian tragedies of recent times unfolding in the Horn of Africa, and moved in to ameliorate the widespread famine there."
"Now, poor rains, crop shortages, and continuing conflict could cause millions to be plunged back into life-threatening levels of hunger and malnutrition."
Emergency assistance is crucial in this fragile time; but it is not enough.
Only if the agricultural sector’s fundamental inadequacies are addressed can the region truly escape famine’s blight.
Africa is endowed with 60% of the world’s unused arable land and millions of dedicated farmers.
"They simply need the tools, infrastructure, and competence to unlock the continent’s tremendous agricultural potential."
There is no reason – and no excuse – to leave the survival of millions to unpredictable weather conditions.
"Rather, countries must take control by drastically improving efficiency and productivity."
"To be sure, progress has been made."
Some African governments have reduced regulatory barriers to private-sector investment in agriculture.
"And some are implementing risk-management and hedging tools to shield farmers from drought and flood, and poor consumers from the food-price volatility that such disasters cause."
"For example, the Global Index Insurance Facility insures Kenyan farmers against drought or excessive rainfall."
"Such initiatives foster the flow of resources into agriculture – both for the agribusinesses needed to feed Africa’s growing cities, and for smallholders who need better seeds, fertilizer, and market roads."
"Although more developed regions have been taking such measures, they are not yet standard practice in Africa."
"The continent’s agricultural sector is further hindered by low skills, a dearth of innovation, weak infrastructure, little funding, and lack of access to land, land titles, and lender security."
"But, given the right tools, all of these problems are solvable."
"For example, in order to finance reform, local banks need incentives to expand credit."
"That could mean access to specialized credit bureaus and rating agencies, risk-sharing facilities targeting smallholders, and advisory services to provide capacity-building and education."
These banks also need direct support.
"For example, the International Finance Corporation is investing $25 million in Zambia National Commercial Bank to increase access to finance for small-scale entrepreneurs and rural agribusiness companies, which account for a significant share of Zambia’s economic output."
"Moreover, innovative financing techniques – such as structured trade finance, warehouse receipt finance, and supplier finance – are already in place or being developed."
"Under the Global Warehouse Receipt Program, for example, farmers may use produce stored in depositories as collateral for loans."
Smallholder farm-mechanization models are also needed to improve efficiency and increase yields.
"Farmers could be grouped together to pool their production and negotiate a favorable offtake agreement to monetize future sales, then use the receipts to lease equipment, such as tractors."
Water is another major constraint on food production in some regions.
"Most affected countries are working to increase supply by developing new sources of ground and surface water, using wastewater from nearby urban areas, harvesting rainwater, or reusing agricultural drainage."
"Meanwhile, some countries are focusing on reducing demand, through improved management and innovative agricultural techniques, such as precision and drip irrigation."
Africa also needs better infrastructure in order to boost food output.
Limited access to electricity means that cold storage is lacking; poorly maintained roads slow down old vehicles; and inefficient ports often leave food to rot on the docks.
Production is meaningless if fresh products do not make it to market in good condition and at a reasonable cost.
"Finally, Africa’s transformation into an agricultural powerhouse must be based on inclusiveness and environmental sustainability."
"Investments should ensure an equitable division of benefits between producers and consumers, and include smallholder participation and linkages to markets for inputs and outputs."
"And investors must account for the interests of host countries, local communities, and the environment – an approach that is both good and good business."
Long-term food security in Africa is possible.
"In fact, it is only the first step on the road to a booming agricultural export sector for Africa."
"By acting now, African and international leaders can ensure not only the continent’s food security, but also a prosperous, inclusive economy."
Africa’s Misplaced Monetary Ambition
DAKAR – Sub-Saharan African is in the grip of currency-union mania.
"Regional groups of countries in eastern, southern, and western Africa are all giving priority to the idea of creating a monetary union."
But haven’t we heard this all before in Africa?
"Indeed, today’s enthusiasm for currency unions ignores the poor track record of previous attempts on the continent to establish them through peaceful means."
A common currency requires unified and centrally agreed monetary and fiscal policies.
"But this necessitates political integration, which, as the troubles of the euro this year have demonstrated, is a hard sell among nation-states."
"Before the euro’s arrival on the international financial scene in 1999, the only examples of countries with common currencies were neo-colonial francophone Africa and nineteenth-century precedents like the Latin American and Scandinavian monetary unions."
"The creation of the CFA franc, which gives France control of 65% of the CFA countries’ foreign-exchange reserves, combined currency convertibility with a grossly overvalued parity – pegged first to the French franc and now to the euro – as well as trade barriers."
"This led only to structural deficits, vast capital flight, and, in 1994, a 100% devaluation."
"Yet, despite the difficulties that have bedeviled the CFA (and the euro of late) – indeed, despite the absence of viable regional customs unions (except in the East African Community), let alone a single market – Africans retain a strong allegiance to the idea of a currency union."
That allegiance is misplaced.
"At this stage of their economic development, with its focus on commodity exports, the priority for Africa’s countries should be long-term economic integration, not currency union."
"Here, the model to follow is not the euro, but Latin America’s Southern Common Market (Mercosur) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)."
"Both regional groupings have, by lowering trade barriers, delivered a real catalyst to economic growth."
Mercosur’s member countries have adopted a strategy that prioritizes the creation of a free-trade area.
"They steered clear of establishing a heavy budget-fueled bureaucracy, leaving respective ministries to handle administering the accord. In 2008, Mercosur intra-regional exports reached $41.6 billion, up by 28.4% from 2007."
"The external trade of Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil within the area amounted, respectively, to 65%, 33%, and 15% of their total exports."
"The other major advantage of such regional groupings has been their ability to attract foreign direct investment. Since the early 1990’s, Mercosur has managed to mobilize 5.9% of world FDI inflows."
"In 2008, it attracted a record $56 billion in FDI, an increase of 31.5 % from 2007. Moreover, cross-investment between Mercosur member countries has led to greater economic integration. Argentina is now Brazil’s second-largest trading partner, behind the United States, while Brazil is Argentina’s largest trading partner, ahead of the US."
"The seven member countries of ASEAN decided to implement economic “roadmaps” defining integration priorities, a testimony to their determination to achieve a single economic community."
"A currency union, however, is not high on the agenda."
"In 2009, ASEAN regional trade represented 24.6% of its members’ total exports and 24.3% of total imports."
"By contrast, trade among African countries accounts for only about 10-12% of the continent’s exports and imports."
"But, partly because several African countries have escaped the hang-over from the global credit crisis, more investors are focusing on business opportunities there."
"By 2050, the combined GDP of the largest 11 African economies should reach more than $13 trillion, surpassing Brazil and Russia (but not China or India)."
"For some analysts, the emergence of countries like Brazil as economic powerhouses stems partly from successful demutualization of their stock exchanges."
"Twenty-three bourses are currently operating in Africa, and their combined market capitalization has soared from $245 billion in 2002 to $1 trillion (2% of the world total) at the end of 2009 – as high as the fifteenth-largest stock exchange in the world."
"With a volume of $800 billion, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange alone accounts for 80% of the total and ranks 19th worldwide."
Nigeria plans to demutualize its stock exchange in order to establish it among the prime destinations for frontier investors.
"Africa stands to benefit from a massive economic turnaround, provided that the right environment for sustainable growth and rising productivity is created."
"This requires consistent macroeconomic policies focused on economic integration, food self-sufficiency, low inflation, and reduced debt."
"It also requires political stability, eradication of corruption, enhanced rule of law, improvement of basic levels of education, and greater use of mobile telephones and the Internet."
What it does not require is a currency union.
"When it comes to exchange rates, the members of Africa’s economic groupings would be better off linking their currencies in regional monetary systems to prevent large fluctuations relative to one another."
Africa\u0027s Oil Rush
It takes a threat to oil supplies to get world leaders to pay attention to Africa.
"Usually neglected by globetrotting statesmen, the continent recently saw visits from US President George W. Bush, Chinese President Hu Jintao, Brazil's Lula Da Silva, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and many other world leaders."
"Their public comments were typically devoted to development, ending Africa's many wars, and the fight against HIV/AIDS, but all of them had oil on their minds."
"An oil rush is underway in the continent, because all developed countries' national security depends on a steady oil supply, and sub-Saharan Africa owns 8% of the world's known reserves."
"In 2002 production was 2.1 million barrels a day in Nigeria, 900,000 in Angola, 283,000 in Congo Brazzaville, 265,000 in Equatorial Guinea, 247,000 in Gabon, 227,000 in Sudan, 75,000 in Cameroon, 28,000 in South Africa, 25,000 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and 11,000 in Ivory Coast."
"The US alone imports 1.5 million barrels a day from West Africa, the same amount it imports from Saudi Arabia."
"According to the US Energy Department, within this decade American oil imports from Africa will reach 770 millions barrels annually, as exploration intensifies throughout the Gulf of Guinea, and as the US brokers peace in war-ravaged oil-producing countries, such as Sudan and Angola, and establishes strategic bases to safeguard output."
"As a result, West African oil producers will be earning an estimated $200 billion over the next decade, more than 10 times the sum Western countries allocate each year to the ""aid industry"" in the region."
So why aren't Africans celebrating?
"Because they are well aware of the ""curse of oil"" - corruption, conflict, ecological disaster, and anaesthetized entrepreneurial spirit."
"In Nigeria, an estimated $300 billion in oil revenues entered the government's coffers over the past 25 years, but per capita income remains less than one dollar a day for the simple reason that much of the money ends up in Swiss bank accounts, like the one owned by the late dictator Sani Abacha."
"In Angola, British Petroleum revealed that it had to pay a $111 million ""signature bonus"" to the government."
"As scandalous as it might be, these sums are mere peanuts compared to the $4.5 billions in oil revenues supposedly siphoned away from African government coffers over the last decade."
But graft and theft are not the only problems.
"The celebrated pipeline between Chad and Cameroon caused water pollution, devastated pygmies' hunting grounds, destroyed harvests, and spread AIDS - perhaps the inevitable result of ill-educated migrant workers toiling thousands of miles from home, with a horde of prostitutes following them."
"Projected annual revenues from this project for oil companies such as Chevron, Exxon, and Petronas, and lenders like the World Bank and the European Investment Bank, are estimated at $4.7 billion."
"Chad will see a mere $62 million, and Cameroon just $18.6 million."
"So petrodollars exacerbate poverty in sub-Saharan Africa, not cure it."
Only openness and accountability can reverse this trend.
"This was the objective set by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which requested that the publication of multinational oil companies' payments to governments be made mandatory."
"Unfortunately, because the companies and African politicians have every reason to avoid transparency, the EITI plans were rendered meaningless when they were not made compulsory."
What lessons can be learned from this sorry state of affairs?
One relates to the defenders of those suffering such obvious exploitation.
"The people who rebelled against these injustices were not Africans, but well-wishers from western organizations such as EITI, the US aid agency Catholic Relief Services (CRS), and Global Witness."
"African intellectuals, artists, and civil rights activists did not feel the need to express solidarity with fellow Africans and to defend the rights of the downtrodden."
African civil society seems trapped in indifference and inertia.
Another lesson concerns Africa's failed political leadership.
"It is customary to link Africa's failures to slavery and colonization, and no one can deny such claims."
"But this recognition does not exonerate Africa's ""kinglets,"" who handed their subjects over to the slave traders."
"Recently, a congregation of African church leaders convened in the Senegalese island of Gorée and urged their people to assess their share of responsibility for the slave trade."
The call went unheeded.
"That is a shame, for here was a moment to expose the flaws of most African leaders throughout our tormented history."
The constant ability of Africa's leaders to betray their people is the root cause of Africa's current misery.
"Their fecklessness and recklessness are what convince much of the world that Africans can do nothing but dance, slaughter each other, and beg."
Easy access to oil wealth only allows their cynical frivolity to continue.
If Africa's oil wealth is to be exploited - and it
Africa’s Press: Missing in Action
"In much of Africa, the challenge for journalists, editors, and readers goes beyond freedom of the press, and involves its very survival."
"Under Nigeria’s various dictatorships, for example, many journalists underwent a rite of passage that most prefer to forget: routine harassment, beatings, torture, frame-ups on spurious charges, and incongruously long prison sentences."
"Among the numerous victims, perhaps the most bizarre case was that of a young journalist named Bagauda Kaltho."
His body was found in a hotel toilet in the city of Kaduna with the remains of a parcel bomb after an explosion that no one heard.
"Yet there he lay, and with a copy of my book The Man Died beside him."
"The implication, encouraged by the regime, was that Kaltho was a recruit of mine who blew himself up while preparing his next bomb in a campaign of terror aimed at Sanni Abacha’s dictatorship."
This unconscionable fabrication was fully exposed only after Abacha’s death and the spate of confessions that followed it by the police agents who actually committed the crime.
"The press fought back tenaciously, despite casualties."
"Journalists adopted tactics of underground publication, in the best tradition of East European samizdat."
"When police raided one place, copies emerged from other secure depots, to be sold in the streets by kamikaze youths who darted in and out of traffic offering the subversive contraband."
"It did not matter that these youthful hawkers, some no more than seven or eight years old, were often arrested, beaten, and locked up for weeks, occasionally months."
"When they emerged from prison, they returned to their dangerous work."
But Nigeria does not offer the premier example of the awesome power of the press.
That honor belongs to a different history and region.
"If benchmarks such as focus, mobilization, commitment, organization, and sheer impact are any guide, then the prize goes to the media’s baleful role in preparing the Rwandan massacre of 1994, and in directing, overseeing, and stoking the fervor of the génocidaires once the extermination of Tutsis began."
"It remains a sobering lesson, one that presents the media in the role of aggressor and violator, in contrast to their normal position as victim."
Those events are too familiar to require re-hashing.
"What matters now is the role that the rest of the African media should have played, and the questions that this raises about their capacity to function as a watchdog."
"Not many Africans, even among those who are knowledgeable in world affairs, had ever heard of Radio Milles Collines, the most blatant instrument of the Rwandan genocide."
It is chastening that events primarily concerning Africans enter the public domain mainly owing to the intervention of the foreign media.
It was they who exposed the complicity of certain foreign powers in an ongoing crime against humanity.
"And it was the foreign press that detailed the parallel failure of the United Nations, whose agents were on the ground but whose inability to call genocide by its proper name led to a comatose response."
"Simply put, the African media failed to reach beyond immediate borders and serve as a voice for the continent in its encounters with the world."
The African media’s response to the massacres and rapes in Darfur has been equally muted.
"Once again, African readers are being shortchanged, remaining dependent on foreign reportage in order to grasp the enormity of what is transpiring."
"African civil society, whose mouthpiece is the press, cannot escape some measure of reproach for its failure to urge leaders to rescue fellow Africans."
"From Liberia to the Congo, the predicament of the African continent today demands that the press act not only as a watchdog, but as a goad."
It is to the media that the continent must look for an example of solidarity.
Such solidarity should not be understood as something to be exercised only in times of convulsion.
"The cheap recourse to dismissive invectives such as “outside interference,” “jaundiced reporting,” and “imperial mouthpiece” – so beloved by corrupt and/or repressive regimes – is recognized as self-serving cant even by those who routinely mouth them."
"Africa’s media must respond with its own analyses, explanations, and narratives."
"Unfortunately, in repressive conditions such as those in, say, Zimbabwe, Third-World journalists tend to take their cues from the conduct of their national leaders and close ranks around the continent’s rogue elephants."
"This reflex has left Zimbabwe practically a journalism-free zone, with only the foreign press seeking to hold President Robert Mugabe to account."
"Imitation appears to be a hallmark of tyrants in their exercise of power, so the absence of solidarity among Africa’s journalists and Africa’s peoples has created a dangerous vacuum."
Today it is Zimbabwe’s press that is under the gun.
Tomorrow?
"We should all bear this in mind, for territorial ambition often goes hand in hand with the censor’s creed."
Africa’s Stolen History
NAIROBI – The news that Yale University has agreed to return thousands of artifacts that one of its researchers took from Peru in 1911 reminded me of a party that I attended recently – one that I had to leave prematurely.
"An African friend had invited me to the event, at an acquaintance’s home."
"The host, a wealthy American, proudly displayed his collection of paintings and sculptures."
"As he showed us around, there was one object that appeared to be African, but I wasn’t sure; on occasion, I have identified art as African only to learn that it was, in fact, Native American."
"The piece was an animal skin stretched and decorated with colored beads, and framed behind glass."
"The beads were the same kind that my people, the Maasai, use, but the dominant color was blue, not our preferred red."
"“Where is that from?” I asked, pointing at the piece on the wall."
"“That is from Zimbabwe,” our host replied."
“It’s a wedding skirt that was worn in a Ndebele royal wedding in 1931.”
"For an African away from home, finding even the most insignificant African object on display can make you happy."
"When I see Kenyan or Ethiopian coffee for sale in New York or Paris, for example, it makes me proud that there are Americans and Europeans who consider a product from my homeland valuable."
Learning that a wealthy American had found a traditional African skirt worthy of a place in his home triggered the same feeling.
But our host’s next remark erased it instantly.
He boasted that he had acquired the skirt illegally through a friend who had “paid” a Zimbabwean government official to smuggle it out of the country.
"My friend and I looked at each other, trying hard not to show our disapproval."
"“I’m so disgusted,” my friend said a moment later."
“Let’s leave before I get drunk and say something inappropriate to this guy.”
We left the party.
"On the way home, we ranted angrily about what we had witnessed."
But our contempt was driven more by the West’s role in supporting corruption in Africa than by the fate of the specific Zimbabwean artifact we had seen.
It wasn’t until I heard that Yale had returned the Peruvian objects that I began to think about African artifacts as culturally and historically important.
"Many African artifacts have, of course, ended up in Western museums or in the hands of private Western collectors."
The pieces are largely the loot that Europeans pillaged from Africa during the slave trade and the colonial period.
Perhaps the most famous is the sculpture known as Bangwa Queen.
"Valued at millions of dollars, it is the world’s most expensive piece of African art."
"African art exhibitions usually include stories about each piece’s origins, which are often tied to an African kingdom."
But information about an artifact’s journey to the West is often vague or nonexistent.
"For example, The New York Times published an article last year about an African art exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum."
The Times reported that the Bangwa Queen has been owned by many famous collectors “since she left her Cameroonian royal shrine in the late nineteenth century.”
"In fact, the Bangwa Queen “left” Cameroon with Gustav Conrau, a German colonial explorer who later gave the statue to a museum in his home country."
"Considering the suspect tactics that colonial agents typically used to separate Africans from their possessions, it is unlikely that the Bangwa Queen left willingly."
"African artifacts on display in New York, London, Paris, and elsewhere have similar stories."
Peru’s reclamation of its cultural heritage made me wish the same for Africa’s looted artifacts.
But Peru is fundamentally different from any African country.
Its demand reflected a reverence for its past.
"To Peruvians, the artifacts are a reminder of the great Inca civilization that European conquerors destroyed."
"Africans, on the other hand, tend to discount their past."
"To some extent, Africans appear to have internalized the condescending colonialist idea that Africa was primitive and needed to be civilized."
"We don’t treasure our historical artifacts, because they remind us of our rich civilizations’ supposed inferiority."
It is no wonder that an object as culturally important as a royal wedding skirt can be smuggled out of a country without anyone noticing.
"Until Africans recognize the value of their history, their cultures’ artistic output will continue to be up for grabs."
Africa’s Urban Farmer
"NAIROBI – When I met Eunice Wangari at a Nairobi coffee shop recently, I was surprised to hear her on her mobile phone, insistently asking her mother about the progress of a corn field in her home village, hours away from the big city."
"A nurse, Wangari counts on income from farming to raise money to buy more land – for more farming."
"Even though Wangari lives in Kenya’s capital, she is able to reap hundreds of dollars a year in profit from cash crops grown with the help of relatives."
Her initial stake – drawn from her nursing wages of about $350 a month – has long since been recovered.
"Wangari is one of thousands of urban workers in Kenya – and one of hundreds of thousands, even millions, across Africa – who are increasing their incomes through absentee agriculture."
"With prices for basic foodstuffs at their highest levels in decades, many urbanites feel well rewarded by farming."
"Absentee agriculture also bolsters national pride – and pride in traditional diets – by specializing in vegetables specific to the region. “For too long our country has been flooded with imported food and Westernized foods,” Wangari says."
"Across Africa, political leaders, long dismissive of rural concerns, have awakened to the importance of agriculture and the role that educated people, even those living in major cities, can play in farming."
"In Nigeria, former President Olusegun Obasanjo has a huge diversified farm and has pushed for policies to help absentee farmers prosper."
"In Uganda, Vice President Gilbert Bukenya routinely travels the country, promoting higher-value farming, such as dairy production."
"Perhaps the most visible political support for absentee agriculture is in Liberia, a small West African country where civil war destroyed agriculture, rendering the population dependent on food imports, even today."
"President Johnson-Sirleaf, recognizing that educated people could contribute much to an agriculture revival, launched her “Back to the Soil” campaign in June 2008 in large part to encourage urban dwellers to farm."
"To be sure, absentee farming by elites and educated urban workers can’t solve all of Africa’s urgent food needs."
"Moreover, absentee farmers face unexpected problems."
"Because they don’t visit their fields often, they rely heavily on relatives and friends. When I decided to farm wheat for the first time this spring on leased land in my childhood village, my mother agreed to supervise plowing, planting, and harvesting."
"Without her help, I might not have farmed at all."
"Even with mother’s help, I have worries."
"Although I grew up around wheat fields, my knowledge of farming is thin."
Fertilizer and spraying were both more expensive than I thought.
"While my wheat stalks are sprouting on schedule, I now fear that at harvest time – in November – prices will fall and I won’t recoup my costs."
One key tool is the mobile phone.
My hopes for success are buoyed by my ability to call my mother inexpensively and discuss the farm.
We even decided over the phone what kind of pesticide to use and which tractor company to hire.
"Because they know both the tastes of fellow city dwellers and rural conditions, many urban farmers are succeeding."
"In fact, some city dwellers don’t even bother with acquiring land or gaining distant help."
Certain crops can be grown in their own homes.
"James Memusi, an accountant, grows mushrooms in a spare bedroom, selling them to nearby hotels and supermarkets."
"Nevertheless, most people living in Africa’s cities have access to land in the countryside, which is why Liberia’s government rightly highlights the potential for farm expansion."
"In a new advertising campaign rolled out this summer, the authorities declared, “The soil is a bank; invest in it.”"
"In Liberia, the main push is to reduce imports of staples such as rice and tomatoes."
"In more prosperous countries, African elites are motivated by a complex interplay of national pride, dietary concerns, and the pursuit of profit."
"In Zambia, for example, Sylva Banda ignited a craze for authentic traditional meals two decades ago with a chain of popular restaurants."
"Now, ordinary Lusakans want to cook similar meals in their own homes, driving demand for farmers who produce such delicacies as dried pumpkin, “black jack” leaves, and fresh Okra."
"Similarly, in Nairobi, Miringo Kinyanjui, another woman entrepreneur, is supplying unrefined – and more nutritious – maize and wheat flour."
"In another move to distinguish her ingredients from Western versions, Kinyanjui also sells through grocery stores flour flavored with Amarathan, a green vegetable that grows around Kenya."
The revival of traditional foods has attracted the attention of large multinational corporations.
"Last year, Unilever’s Kenyan branch ran a “taste our culture” campaign in support of its line of traditional East African herbs and spices."
"Such campaigns go hand-in-hand with expanded farming, because sellers of these foods prefer nearby growers – even if these growers increasingly live in the city."
After Austerity
NEW YORK – This year’s annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund made clear that Europe and the international community remain rudderless when it comes to economic policy.
"Financial leaders, from finance ministers to leaders of private financial institutions, reiterated the current mantra: the crisis countries have to get their houses in order, reduce their deficits, bring down their national debts, undertake structural reforms, and promote growth."
"Confidence, it was repeatedly said, needs to be restored."
"It is a little precious to hear such pontifications from those who, at the helm of central banks, finance ministries, and private banks, steered the global financial system to the brink of ruin – and created the ongoing mess."
"Worse, seldom is it explained how to square the circle."
How can confidence be restored as the crisis economies plunge into recession?
"How can growth be revived when austerity will almost surely mean a further decrease in aggregate demand, sending output and employment even lower?"
This we should know by now: markets on their own are not stable.
"Not only do they repeatedly generate destabilizing asset bubbles, but, when demand weakens, forces that exacerbate the downturn come into play."
"Unemployment, and fear that it will spread, drives down wages, incomes, and consumption – and thus total demand."
"Decreased rates of household formation – young Americans, for example, are increasingly moving back in with their parents – depress housing prices, leading to still more foreclosures."
States with balanced-budget frameworks are forced to cut spending as tax revenues fall – an automatic destabilizer that Europe seems mindlessly bent on adopting.
There are alternative strategies.
"Some countries, like Germany, have room for fiscal maneuver."
"Using it for investment would enhance long-term growth, with positive spillovers to the rest of Europe."
"A long-recognized principle is that balanced expansion of taxes and spending stimulates the economy; if the program is well designed (taxes at the top, combined with spending on education), the increase in GDP and employment can be significant."
Europe as a whole is not in bad fiscal shape; its debt-to-GDP ratio compares favorably with that of the United States.
"If each US state were totally responsible for its own budget, including paying all unemployment benefits, America, too, would be in fiscal crisis."
The lesson is obvious:&#160; the whole is more than the sum of its parts.
"If Europe – particularly the European Central Bank – were to borrow, and re-lend the proceeds, the costs of servicing Europe’s debt would fall, creating room for the kinds of expenditure that would promote growth and employment."
"There are already institutions within Europe, such as the European Investment Bank, that could help finance needed investments in the cash-starved economies."
The EIB should expand its lending.
"There need to be increased funds available to support small and medium-size enterprises – the main source of job creation in all economies – which is especially important, given that credit contraction by banks hits these enterprises especially hard."
Europe’s single-minded focus on austerity is a result of a misdiagnosis of its problems.
"Greece overspent, but Spain and Ireland had fiscal surpluses and low debt-to-GDP ratios before the crisis."
Giving lectures about fiscal prudence is beside the point.
Taking the lectures seriously – &#160;even adopting tight budget frameworks –&#160;can be counterproductive.
"Regardless of whether Europe’s problems are temporary or fundamental – the eurozone, for example, is far from an “optimal” currency area, and tax competition in a free-trade and free-migration area can erode a viable state – austerity will make matters worse."
The consequences of Europe’s rush to austerity will be long-lasting and possibly severe.
"If the euro survives, it will come at the price of high unemployment and enormous suffering, especially in the crisis countries."
And the crisis itself almost surely will spread.
"Firewalls won’t work, if kerosene is simultaneously thrown on the fire, as Europe seems committed to doing: there is no example of a large economy – and Europe is the world’s largest – recovering as a result of austerity."
"As a result, society’s most valuable asset, its human capital, is being wasted and even destroyed."
"Young people who are long deprived of a decent job – and youth unemployment in some countries is approaching or exceeding 50%, and has been unacceptably high since 2008 – become alienated."
"When they eventually find work, it will be at a much lower wage."
"Normally, youth is a time when skills get built up; now, it is a time when they atrophy."
"So many economies are vulnerable to natural disasters – earthquakes, floods, typhoons, hurricanes, tsunamis –&#160;that adding a man-made disaster is all the more tragic."
But that is what Europe is doing.
"Indeed, its leaders’ willful ignorance of the lessons of the past is criminal."
"The pain that Europe, especially its poor and young, is suffering is unnecessary."
"Fortunately, there is an alternative."
"But delay in grasping it will be very costly, and Europe is running out of time."
After Chernobyl
"KIEV: Chernobyl, the world’s most notorious nuclear power plant, will be shut down today, fourteen years after it spewed clouds of radioactive dust into the atmosphere."
"Back then, Ukraine became the focus of global attention, but Ukrainians learned of the disaster much later than the rest of the world."
"I recall that fateful Saturday afternoon with utter clarity, strolling through Kiev with my six-year-old daughter, oblivious to the danger."
"Chernobyl changed Ukraine forever, and was a catalyst for the downfall of the Soviet Union."
"Ultimately, Chernobyl changed the world."
"Now that Chernobyl will be permanently shut down, world attention again turns to Ukraine, this time in hope, not fear."
"Shutting down a vital source of electrical energy, which Chernobyl remains, is no an easy task, particularly with winter upon us."
Ukraine’s energy infrastructure is weak; losing 8-10% of our electricity production and $100 million in revenues will strain the system even more.
"We also bear the responsibilities involved in laying off Chernobyl’s workers and depriving the adjacent city of Slavutych (population 28,000), of its main source of income."
"Moreover, we must continue dealing with the technical and ecological issues surrounding the Chernobyl sarcophagus, as well as maintain nuclear safety in the remaining nuclear plants in operation in Ukraine, including what is left of Chernobyl."
"In recent years, Ukraine alone financed all the costs of dealing with the Chernobyl disaster, consistently spending 5-10% of our state budget revenues to this end."
Dealing with the aftermath of the disaster will remain a financial burden even with the plant closed.
Yet closing the plant proves that we keep our promises.
We committed to shut down Chernobyl this year in an agreement with the G-7 countries and the European Commission.
"Closure of the last remaining reactor at Chernobyl, I believe, must mark the beginning of a new phase of cooperation with the European Union and G-7 countries."
"Closing Chernobyl may be the most dramatic, but it is only a single episode in our reform efforts."
"When we gained independence, the world expected great things from Ukraine."
"Over the course of a decade, the world appeared to forget about us."
Now we finally have a chance to break out of the downward spiral of economic decline.
"At long last, our society and economy are set on the path to growth and development."
"After pro-reform forces secured victory in last year’s presidential elections, all of the branches of government began cooperating to entrench democracy and the market economy in Ukraine."
"For the first time since independence, Ukraine recorded growth in industrial output of 12.5% in the first 11 months of 2000, and GDP has grown by 5.4% this year."
"Tough decisions were made, not least involving the energy sector."
"Barter payments, -- which stifled the energy market -- were eliminated. So too tax breaks and other privileges that skewed the playing field in favor of a select few."
We are also doing everything possible to make Ukraine attractive to foreign investors.
"In the energy sector, we are privatizing state-owned energy distributors."
"To ensure complete transparency in the tender process, and eliminate problems experienced in the past, Western advisors are assisting us."
For our intention is to attract large Western energy companies with experience in this field as strategic investors.
"Ten leading international energy companies, indeed, will participate in the privatization of the first group of companies."
"By the end of next year, we will privatize 12 additional energy companies."
"In its sheer scale, this may be the largest single energy privatization ever attempted in Europe."
Our energy companies service a territory the size of France; they will all be privatized.
"Of course, these reforms are resisted, primarily by the oligarchs who thrive on a lack of transparency and use privileged access to state resources to enhance their business interests."
"By eliminating barter and requiring monetary payment, we curtailed their opportunities to profit at the state’s expense."
"Although we can and will continue the fight against corruption, we cannot do everything alone."
International support for our efforts is crucial.
"A positive sign here is the recent decision by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to provide $215 million to complete the nuclear power stations at Rivne and Khmelnytsky, which will compensate for the loss of Chernobyl’s generating capacity."
Euroatom is also helping with a loan of $585 million to finance repairs at Ukraine’s functioning nuclear power plants.
"In return, Ukraine will uphold its end of the deal: in addition to closing Chernobyl, we will introduce Western nuclear safety standards and renew cooperation with the IMF via the Extended Fund Facility program."
We still need other potential creditors to confirm their involvement.
Closing Chernobyl will not eliminate the Chernobyl threat.
Our people will be unable to live on thousands of acres of contaminated earth for hundreds of years.
The concrete sarcophagus built over the destroyed reactor must be renovated.
"We are grateful to all the donor countries who, with contributions from our own state budget, helped raise the $760 million needed to make the sarcophagus safer."
"In the end, Chernobyl’s legacy does not belong solely to Ukraine, for ours is a country located in the heart of Europe."
We are a European nation.
We realize that no one will implement reforms for us.
"The West can, however, help speed up and facilitate our efforts, as it did with the closure of Chernobyl."
"Cooperation between Ukraine and the West, without a disaster to concentrate everyone’s minds, will benefit all concerned."
After Kyoto
The Kyoto Protocol treaty has now entered into force for the 126 nations who have joined it so far.
"Now is the time to start thinking about how to engage all nations, including large emitters, in conversations about what to do after the treaty’s expiration in 2012."
"This is exactly what the European Commission did recently by providing its first strategy for a post-Kyoto era, which will be discussed by the European Council next March."
"While the Kyoto Protocol represents only a modest reduction of carbon emissions in industrialized countries – 5.2% between 2008-2012 relative to 1990 levels, with varying targets for individual countries – real progress can be made in sustaining development efforts and preserving our planet."
"But first, all countries must integrate climate concerns into policy planning, and improve their governance in key sectors such as energy, infrastructure, and transport."
"In other words, we must act in accordance with the recognition that climate change and its effects on people in both rich and poor countries remains a threat to global security."
"At the end of the day, the long-term approach is likely to include a rules-based system, an incentives system, and investments in technology change."
"Increasingly, adaptation at the national level will be recognized as a major issue that will require appropriate funding."
"Dealing with the impacts of climate change and with emission reductions should not be mutually exclusive, but complementary."
Looking ahead to the post-Kyoto world offers us the chance to start a new dialogue and to look at new options on climate change.
"Nations could set the more ambitious goal of limiting the long-term change in the earth’s temperature, and then assign emissions rights among countries in such a way that will eventually limit temperature increases to an acceptable level."
This would require increasing investments in energy research and development for new and improved technologies – a process that needs to be supported by stronger public-private partnerships.
"Up to now, with only 15% of the world’s population, rich countries have been responsible for more than 75% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and thus most of the environmental damage."
"However, it is the developing countries – and thus the world’s poor – who are most vulnerable."
"It is unrealistic to ask poor countries, where more than 1.6 billion people do not have access to clean energy and technologies, to bear the costs associated with the much needed technological change."
"Working with partners, the World Bank is supporting financial strategies to assist developing countries in meeting the costs caused by climate change."
"To date, over $1 billion dollars in Global Environment Facility (GEF) grants, together with about $8 billion in co-financing, have been committed to programs related to climate change."
"While the regulatory mechanisms of both Kyoto and the European Trading Scheme have contributed to the establishment of an emerging market for carbon trading, interested parties are now concerned about the immediate future."
"Without a regulatory framework beyond 2012, the window of opportunity for initiating project-based transactions will close by 2006/2007."
"Given the long lead time between project preparation and the first benefits of emissions reductions, project developers have only a few years to act before carbon payments cease to make a meaningful contribution to project finance in the current context."
"Developing infrastructure projects is a long process that requires 3-7 years from identification, through licensing, financing, and construction, and finally to the first certification of carbon emission reductions."
"Therefore, projects need to be operational at the latest by 2007."
"The World Bank has been instrumental in advancing carbon finance as a viable development tool, and in facilitating private-sector participation in the market."
"The Bank is focused on representing the interests of its borrowing countries, helping them to develop assets for carbon trading according to their own priorities."
"But, without a commitment by governments to limit greenhouse gas emissions beyond 2012, the carbon market will remain uncertain, and the private sector – vital to the market’s success – is unlikely to expand its participation in a meaningful and sustained way."
"According to a recent World Bank-supported survey of companies interested in carbon finance, only one in five respondents declared that they were interested in buying post-2012 emissions reductions."
"Now is the chance to look forward and enlist the global community – with no exclusions, although with differentiated responsibilities – in the pursuit of a more secure world, one that avoids the dire risks of environmental degradation and social conflict implied by inaction."
"After Neoliberalism, What?"
Two decades of applying neoliberal economic policies to the developing world have yielded disappointing results.
"Latin America, the region that tried hardest to implement the ""Washington Consensus"" recipes--free trade, price deregulation, and privatization--has experienced low and volatile growth, with widening inequalities."
"Among the former socialist economies of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, few have caught up with real output levels that prevailed before 1990."
"In Sub-Saharan Africa, most economies failed to respond to the adjustment programs demanded by the IMF and World Bank."
The few instances of success occurred in countries that marched to their own drummers--and that are hardly poster children for neoliberalism.
"China, Vietnam, India: all three violated virtually every rule in the neoliberal guidebook, even as they moved in a more market-oriented direction."
It is time to abandon neoliberalism and the Washington Consensus.
"But the challenge is to provide an alternative set of policy guidelines for promoting development, without falling into the trap of promulgating yet another impractical blueprint, supposedly right for all countries at all times."
"The record suggests that an adequate growth program needs to be anchored in two strategies: an investment strategy designed to kick-start growth in the short term, and an institution-building strategy designed to provide an economy with resilience in the face of adverse shocks."
The key to investment strategy is to get domestic entrepreneurs excited about the home economy.
Encouraging foreign investment or liberalizing everything and then waiting for things to improve does not work.
"An effective strategy must accomplish two tasks: encourage investment in non-traditional areas, and weed out projects and investments that fail."
"For this, governments must deploy both the carrot and the stick."
Learning what a country is (or can be) good at producing is a key challenge of economic development.
"The carrot is needed because there is great social value in discovering, for example, that cut flowers, or soccer balls, or computer software can be produced at low cost, because this knowledge can orient the investments of other entrepreneurs."
"The entrepreneur who makes the initial ""discovery"" can capture only a small part of the social value that this knowledge generates, as other entrepreneurs will quickly emulate him."
"Consequently, entrepreneurship of this type--learning what can be produced--will typically be under-supplied in the absence of non-market incentives."
"In turn, the stick is needed to ensure that these incentives do not lock in unproductive and wasteful investments."
"Implementing such a strategy may differ from country to country, depending on administrative capacity, the prevailing incentive regime, the flexibility of the fiscal system, the degree of sophistication of the financial sector, and the underlying political economy."
"Time-bound subsidy schemes, public venture funds, and export subsidization are some of the ways in which this approach can be implemented, but there are many others."
No single instrument will work everywhere.
Governments without adequate capacity to exercise leadership over their private sectors are likely to mess things up rather than improve allocation of resources.
"The job can be done, but economic growth requires more than eliciting a temporary boost in investment and entrepreneurship."
It also requires effort to build four types of institutions required to maintain growth momentum and build resilience to shocks:
Market-creating institutions (for property rights and contract enforcement);
"Market-regulating institutions (for externalities, economies of scale, and information about companies);"
Market-stabilizing institutions (for monetary and fiscal management);
Market-legitimizing institutions (for social protection and insurance).
"Building and solidifying these institutions, however, takes time."
Using an initial period of growth to experiment and innovate on these fronts can pay high dividends later on.
"A key point here is that institutional arrangements are, by necessity, country-specific."
Discovering what works in any one country requires experimentation.
"After all, institutions are not hot-house plants capable of being planted in any soil and climate."
Reforms that succeed in one setting may perform poorly or fail completely in others.
"Such specificity helps explain why successful countries--China, India, South Korea, and Taiwan, among others--usually combined unorthodox elements with orthodox policies."
"It also accounts for why important institutional differences persist among the advanced countries of North America, Western Europe, and Japan in areas such as the role of the public sector, the legal system, corporate governance, financial markets, labor markets, and social insurance."
"While economic analysis can help in making institutional choices, there is also a large role for public deliberation and collective choice."
"In fact, we can think of participatory democracy as a meta-institution that helps select among the ""menu"" of possible institutional arrangements in each area."
Designing such a growth strategy is both harder and easier than implementing standard neoliberal policies.
It is harder because the binding constraints on growth are usually country-specific and do not respond well to standardized recipes.
"But it is easier because once those constraints are appropriately targeted, relatively simple policy changes can yield enormous economic payoffs and start a virtuous cycle of growth and institutional reform."
Adopting this approach does not mean abandoning mainstream economics--far from it.
Neoliberalism is to neoclassical economics as astrology is to astronomy.
"In both cases, it takes a lot of blind faith to go from one to the other."
Critics of neoliberalism should not oppose mainstream economics--only its misuse.
Selepas Serangan di Pari
"NEW YORK – Sejumlah serangan di Paris yang dilakukan oleh beberapa pelaku yang terkait dengan Islamic State atau ISIS (Negara Islam Irak dan Suriah), yang terjadi setelah dua bom meledak di Beirut dan jatuhnya pesawat Rusia di Semenanjung Sinai, kembali menegaskan fakta bahwa ancaman teroris telah memasuki fase baru dan semakin berbahaya."
"Alasan mengapa ISIS memutuskan untuk melakukan serangannya sekarang masih berupa dugaan; barangkali ISIS memperluas terornya ke tingkat global untuk mengimbangi kehilangan wilayah mereka di Irak. Tetapi, apapun alasannya, wajib bagi kita untuk memberi respon jelas."
"Sebetulnya, tantangan yang ditimbulkan ISIS justru menjadi seruan bagi kita untuk menerapkan beberapa tindakan, sebab tidak ada kebijakan tunggal yang memadai."
Berbagai upaya perlu diterapkan di berbagai bidang.
"Pertama, militer."
"Serangan udara yang lebih kuat untuk melemahkan aset-aset militer, fasilitas minyak dan gas, dan para pemimpin ISIS sangat penting. Meskipun demikian, serangan udara saja tidak akan cukup."
Unsur militer yang kuat di darat juga diperlukan jika ingin mengambil alih dan mempertahankan wilayah darat.
"Sayangnya, kita tidak punya cukup waktu untuk membangun kekuatan gabungan di darat dari nol."
"Upaya ini sudah dicoba namun gagal, dan negara-negara Arab tidak mampu atau tidak mau membentuk armadanya."
Tentara Irak pun gagal memenuhi harapan.
Kelompok milisi yang didukung Iran justru memperburuk keadaan.
Pilihan terbaik adalah bekerja sama lebih erat dengan tentara Kurdi dan memilih warga dari suku Sunni di Irak dan Suriah.
"Hal ini berarti menyediakan intelijen, senjata, dan kemauan untuk menugaskan lebih banyak tentara – lebih dari 3.500 tentara Amerika sudah bertugas disana dan kemungkinan akan ada penambahan 10.000 tentara – untuk melatih, memberi masukan, dan membantu mengarahkan tindakan militer."
Upaya seperti ini harus bersifat kolektif.
"Bentuknya bisa informal – “koalisi negara-negara yang bersedia” (coalition of the willing) yang meliputi Amerika Serikat, Perancis, Britania Raya, negara-negara Arab, dan bahkan Rusia dalam kondisi yang tepat – atau dilaksanakan di bawah naungan NATO atau PBB."
"Tidak masalah apapun bentuk atau kemasannya, yang penting adalah hasilnya."
"Tetapi, deklarasi perang secara simbolis haruslah dipertimbangkan dengan penuh kehati-hatian, jangan sampai ISIS terkesan memenangi perang ini."
Komponen diplomasi pun tidak kalah penting dibanding tindakan lainnya.
"Presiden Suriah, Bashar al-Assad, adalah sosok yang layaknya menjadi recruiting tools bagi ISIS dan harus dicopot dari jabatannya. Siapapun yang meneruskan jabatan beliau harus mampu menjaga ketertiban dan melarang ISIS memanfaatkan kekosongan kekuasaan, seperti yang terjadi di Libya."
"Selain itu, perubahan politik yang teratur hanya akan dimungkinkan melalui dukungan Rusia dan Iran."
"Satu opsi jangka pendek yang patut dicoba adalah pembentukan pemerintah koalisi yang masih dipimpin oleh perwakilan dari kelompok minoritas Alawite, suatu persetujuan yang sepadan dengan mencopot jabatan Assad."
"Secara prinsip, dan seiring berjalannya waktu, pemerintah pusat yang lebih representatif akan terbentuk, walaupun pembahasan mengenai rencana pemilihan umum dalam waktu 18 bulan ke depan nampaknya terlalu bermuluk-muluk."
Mencapai suatu kompromi dalam pembentukan pemerintah hampir mustahil.
Itulah sebabnya penguatan upaya militer diperlukan untuk menjadikan daerah-daerah kantong lebih aman dan luas sehingga mampu melindungi penduduk sipil dan memerangi ISIS.
"Suriah bukanlah negara yang hidup dalam kondisi layak dan normal, bahkan mungkin tidak akan bisa kembali ke kondisi normal."
Negara Suriah yang terdiri dari daerah-daerah kantong dan canton-canton adalah bentuk yang lebih realistis di masa mendatang.
Elemen lainnya yang sangat diperlukan dalam strategi efektif apapun harus meliputi bantuan tambahan atau memberi tekanan kepada Turki untuk mengambil lebih banyak tindakan demi membendung rekrutmen ISIS.
"Turki, bersama dengan Yordania dan Lebanon, memerlukan bantuan finansial lebih besar sebab mereka memikul sebagian besar beban karena persoalan pengungsi."
Pemimpin Arab dan Muslim dapat berperan dengan menyampaikan pesan untuk menantang visi ISIS dan mendelegitimasi perilaku mereka.
Aspek domestik dalam kebijakan juga diperlukan.
Keamanan dalam negeri dan penegakan hukum – meningkatkan perlindungan baik di wilayah perbatasan dan dalam negeri – harus disesuaikan dengan kenaikan tingkat ancaman.
Retail terrorists – individu atau kelompok melakukan serangan bersenjata ke kelompok rentan di masyarakat – sangat sulit diatasi.
Ancaman dan terjadinya beberapa serangan mengharuskan ketahanan sosial yang lebih kuat dan sedapat mungkin menyeimbangkan ulang antara privasi individu dan keamanan kolektif.
Kita juga perlu menerima fakta dan kenyataan yang ada.
Perjuangan melawan Negara Islam bukanlah perang konvensional.
"Kita tidak bisa memberantas atau menghancurkannya dalam waktu dekat, sebab ISIS merupakan jaringan dan gagasan, serta suatu organisasi dan negara de facto yang mengendalikan wilayah dan sumber daya."
"Memang, terorisme masih dan terus menjadi salah satu momok di era ini."
"Meskipun demikian, kabar baiknya adalah ancaman yang diakibatkan ISIS ke Timur Tengah dan seluruh dunia dapat dikurangi secara signifikan melalui tindakan terpadu dan berkelanjutan."
Pembelajaran utama dari serangan di Paris adalah kita harus siap bertindak kapan pun dan dimanapun.
After Pax Americana?
"NEW YORK – It has become popular to suggest that when the dust settles from the global financial crisis, it may become clear that the United States-led post-war world has come to an end."
"If so, the global system that has secured peace, security, openness, and economic growth over the past six decades could be in grave danger."
"Inspired by American leadership since World War II’s end, Europe, then Japan, then much of Asia and the world rose to new levels of prosperity; the world economy globalized upon the foundation of international institutions, norms, and standards; and foreign students educated in American universities returned home with new ideas about free markets, entrepreneurship, and democracy."
"The US military’s protective umbrella gave large swaths of the world a vacation from war, making it easier for them to focus on economic growth and regional integration."
"America not only took the lead role in building the institutions of a globalizing world – the United Nations, World Bank, IMF, NATO– it also became the model that many other countries looked to for inspiration."
"After eight years of compromised American leadership, a botched war of choice in Iraq, failure to take the lead in global efforts to address climate change, Abu Ghraib, Guantánamo Bay, running up a $10 trillion debt, and igniting a global financial crisis – America’s once-glittering model has lost a good deal of its luster and America’s leadership has been questioned by many."
"The point was driven home at the 7th Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in Beijing this autumn, where European and Asian leaders began exploring ideas for a new global financial structure."
"For much of the past 60 years, it would have been impossible to hold such a fundamental dialogue without US participation."
"Today, it is almost becoming a new global norm that neither the international committee nor the US is prepared for."
"Despite talk about American decline, the world is not prepared for a post-American era."
"As irksome as some of America’s actions have been, particularly over the past eight years, America remains the world’s most critical champion of the progressive values that have lifted hundreds of millions of people out of abject poverty and political repression."
"If the US were to play a relatively smaller role in world affairs, and no other system was created to pick up the slack, these values could be at risk."
"Although many states now hide behind an alleged universal principle of inviolable state sovereignty, for example, would the international community really want to go back to the old model where states did whatever they wanted to their citizens within the confines of their own borders?"
Do countries around the world believe that they will be better off if the global trade system breaks down or international shipping lanes become less secure?
"Are countries like China willing to step up and pay their fair share of dues to keep the UN running (China currently pays 2.1% of UN dues, compared to more than 25% for the US), or to capitalize revised international financial institutions or the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria in a meaningful way?"
"Unless other countries become more willing to step forward for the common good, a post-American world could quickly become a far more frightening environment than what it would replace."
"To make its case for a continued global leadership role, America must, however, step up to the plate. While the go-it-alone impulse of the Bush administration has been discredited by its consequences, the inverse lessons regarding how important collaborative action is in today’s interconnected world are still being learned."
"Even at the apex of American power, America’s greatness was always based on inspiring others, and the opportunities for building market share in that particular category remain unlimited."
"It is impossible to overestimate how significant a step Barack Obama’s election is in this direction, but America’s actions over the coming years will be the ultimate determinant of whether the power of America’s model can be restored."
"America can and should, for example, become the global leader combating climate change through major investments in alternative energy, conservation, and energy efficiency, and by taking strong actions at home to reduce America’s greenhouse gas emissions. It should transform its immigration policy to recruit the best and brightest people from around the world to move to the US and become citizens, and remain the world’s leading champion of open markets, especially during the current financial crisis."
Closing the prison at Guantánamo and reaffirming America’s commitment to international law and human rights will also be an important step in this direction.
The world wants to believe in an America that lives up to its own best values.
The prospect of a truly global community of nations working together to achieve the greater good for all is indeed exciting.
"But, although America has been far from perfect over the last six decades, the end of the"
"If the world is going to shift in the direction of a new and more globally democratic system, other nations will need to meaningfully step forward to assume new responsibilities."
"It is in America’s and the world’s interest that they do so. The evidence of this will be seen not only in global institutions but also in places like Darfur, Zimbabwe, and Burma."
"Until this happens, let us all hope that America can get back on track as the global champion of collaborative action to address the world’s greatest challenges and work with as many other countries as possible to move collectively in the right direction."
Aftershocks from Japan
NEW HAVEN – The devastation – both human and physical – from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan is unfathomable.
It is impossible at this point to gauge the full extent of the damage with any degree of precision. But we can nonetheless begin to assess its potential spillover effects on the rest of Asia and other major economies around the world.
The narrow view of the catastrophe’s economic impact is that Japan doesn’t really matter anymore.
"After all, more than 20 years of unusually sluggish trend growth in Japanese output has sharply reduced its incremental impact on the broader global economy."
"The disaster may produce some disproportionate supply-chain effects in autos and information-technology product lines such as flash drives, but any such disruptions would tend to be transitory."
"On the surface, the world’s two largest economies have little to fear."
Japan accounts for only 5% of America’s exports and 8% of China’s.
"Under the worst-case outcome of a complete disruption to the Japanese economy, the direct repercussions on the United States and Chinese economies would be small – shaving no more than a few tenths of a percentage point off their annual growth rates."
"Within the so-called G-10 developed economies, Australia has the largest direct exposure to Japan – the destination of about 19% of its total exports."
"The eurozone is at the opposite end of the spectrum, with Japan accounting for less than 2% of its exports."
"Among emerging-markets, the Philippines and Indonesia are the most exposed to Japan, which absorbs about 16% of their total exports."
"South Korea, the third-largest economy in East Asia, is at the other end of the scale, relying on Japanese demand for only about 6% of its exports."
But the narrow view misses the most critical consideration: this “Japan shock” has not occurred at a time of great economic strength.
"That is true not only of Japan itself, where two lost decades have left a once-vigorous economy on a less-than-1% growth trajectory since the early 1990’s. But it is also true of the broader global economy, which was only just beginning to recover from the worst financial crisis and recession since the 1930’s."
"Moreover, the Japan shock is not the only negative factor at work today."
The impacts of sharply rising oil prices and ongoing sovereign debt problems in Europe are also very worrisome.
"While each of these shocks may not qualify as the proverbial tipping point, the combination and the context are disconcerting, to say the least."
Context is vital.
"Notwithstanding the euphoric resurgence of global equity markets over the past two years, the world economy remains fragile."
"What markets seem to have forgotten is that post-bubble, post-financial-crisis recoveries tend to be anemic."
"Economies grow at something much closer to their stall speeds, thus lacking the cyclical “escape velocity” required for a self-sustaining recovery."
"As a result, post-crisis economies are far more vulnerable to shocks and prone to relapses than might otherwise be the case."
"Alas, there is an added complication that makes today’s shocks all the more vexing: governments and central banks have exhausted the traditional ammunition upon which they have long relied during times of economic duress."
That is true of both monetary and fiscal policy – the two mainstays of modern countercyclical stabilization.
"Policy interest rates are close to zero in the major economies in the developed world, and outsize budget deficits are the norm."
"As a result, unconventional – and untested – policies, such as so-called “quantitative easing,” have become the rage among central bankers."
"All along, such unconventional policies were viewed as a temporary fix."
"The hope was that policy settings soon would return to pre-crisis norms. But, with one shock following another, the “exit strategy” keeps being deferred."
"Just as it is next to impossible to take a critically ill patient off life-support treatment, it is equally difficult to wean post-bubble economies from their now steady dose of liquidity injections and deficit spending."
"In an era of extraordinarily high unemployment, political pressures only compound the problem."
"This raises perhaps the most troublesome concern of all: with a post-crisis world getting hit by one shock after another, and with central banks having no latitude to cut interest rates, it is not hard to envision a scenario of open-ended monetary expansion that ends in tears."
The dreaded inflationary endgame suddenly looms as a very real possibility.
None of this detracts from the resilience factor.
"Yes, Japan will rebuild, which will undoubtedly spur some type of recovery in its disaster-battered economy."
"That happened in the aftermath of the Hanshin (Kobe) earthquake in 1995, and it will happen this time as well."
"But, just as the post-Kobe rebuilding did little to end the first of Japan’s lost decades, a similar outcome can be expected this time."
The upside of rebuilding – beyond the urgent restoration of normal life for thousands of people – is only a temporary palliative for an impaired economy.
That’s only one of the lessons that Japan offers the rest of us.
"The Japanese economy has, in fact, been on the leading edge of many of the more serious problems that have afflicted the global economy in recent years."
"From asset bubbles and a dysfunctional financial system to currency suppression and monetary-policy blunders, Japan has been in many respects the laboratory of our future."
"Unfortunately, the world has failed to learn the lessons of Japan. And now it risks missing another important clue."
The significance of the earthquake and tsunami of 2011 is not the relatively low magnitude of Japan’s direct impact on the broader global economy.
The more meaningful message is how these shocks box the rest of us into an even tighter corner.
After the Death of Utopia
"A decade ago, people spoke of the end of history, meaning the ultimate triumph of a liberal capitalist political order."
"Nowadays, many scoff at that notion as too simplistic."
"Nonetheless, we are at both the end and beginning of something remarkable."
"In the wake of the death of the utopian - and often bloody - certainties of the 19th and 20th centuries (Communism's collapse was but the latest spectacular example), and with fading belief in the liberal welfare state, traditional views about work, retirement, education, the Church, solidarity, and other social institutions are changing rapidly."
The central driver of all this is today's enormous acceleration in the underlying pace of technological and economic change. Call it fast-forward modernization .
"Of course, the worldwide crash of high-tech stocks in 2000 chilled the hype about a ""new economy"" that seemed to be emerging at the ""end of history."""
"But falling share prices should not blind us to the fact that on top of the ongoing information revolution, three fresh waves of revolutionary technology are poised to hit: bio-technology (including new medical technologies and genetic engineering, such as the creation of human embryos through cloning), nanotechnology, and robotics."
"Each is its own industrial revolution, and will profoundly alter our lives and ways of thinking."
"Indeed, the revolution is already upon us."
"For the first time in history, a global techno-market order is transforming the world of finance, business, politics and, indeed, physiology, beyond recognition."
"This new techno-market system is shaped and characterized by a belief in the increasing importance of knowledge, new ideas, innovations and new technologies, and a higher pace of what the economist Joseph Schumpeter famously called ""creative destruction."""
"As a result, corporate capitalism is rapidly becoming obsolete, replaced by a creative capitalism in which entrepreneurship, combined with a greater willingness to adopt innovations, transforms the business landscape."
Innovative start-up firms become huge companies faster than ever before.
But these infant giants are quickly threatened with eclipse by even newer enterprises.
Take the example of computers.
"It took 15 years for other countries to compete successfully with America's Silicon Valley in semi-conductors, but less than five years in Internet technology."
This system provides unprecedented financial incentives to scientists and entrepreneurs to aggressively develop new technologies and thus become rich.
"But the revolution is not only for the elite; it also offers a realistic (non-utopian) promise of dramatically improved lives for many people around the entire globe - not in 100 years, but in the foreseeable future."
We are not
These changes are also triggering changes in human consciousness.
"The result is a litany of ""post-utopian"" values that include a stronger emphasis on individual freedom and personal responsibility."
"In this world without utopia, individual freedom is the supreme value."
"But, as with any change of such magnitude, there are holdouts."
"Indeed, politics everywhere now seems dominated by the ""war of lifestyles"" that has emerged from today's emphasis on individual autonomy."
"Not so long ago, issues such as the environment, the balance of work versus leisure in daily life, and the role of marriage, abortion, and other family concerns were secondary political disputes, as politicians fought over who would receive what share of a nation's wealth."
Now these issues define domestic political agendas.
"Much of the new battle over lifestyles is undoubtedly misunderstood, perhaps because debates about them are conducted in a simplistic way: anti-global movements versus multi-nationals, environmentalists versus corporate polluters, small farmers versus agro-business, and so on."
"But, beyond slogans, there is an underlying fault line between those who have the cultural capacity to embrace change and those who resist it by adhering to traditional ideas about how one's life and, by extension, society, should be organized."
This conflict exists globally.
"In societies that have been preparing themselves by opening their markets and embracing universal education, the disruptions of this revolution can probably be absorbed and handled."
Conflict is most acute in closed societies characterized by a politically repressive climate and culturally induced obstacles to growth.
"Such obstacles include the absence of an informed and capable workforce, instinctive mistrust and rejection of new ideas and technologies just because they come from the West, lack of respect for those who acquire new knowledge, and endemic discrimination against women."
"The new battle of lifestyles has given rise to new enemies of open societies, such as the Taliban and Al Qaeda."
It is no coincidence that terrorism thrives in societies that are intrinsically hostile to today's modernizing values and belief in individual autonomy.
"So long as these ideas clash, violence will lurk."
"To defend post-utopian values in the longer-term, politicians (and generals and spymasters) cannot seek security by drastically curtailing fundamental freedoms, because to do so risks forfeiting public support and a weakening of the pillars of the post-utopian market order."
"In challenging groups like Al Qaeda, they must understand that they are engaged in a war of ideas; winning the hearts - and the lifestyles - of societies is the only way to win that battle."
After the God that Failed
"Discussing morality and politics, it is said, is like discussing vegetarianism with cannibals."
"Much of the public, it seems, thinks this way--for good reason."
"Moral principles and moral obligations in today's political/economical realm have undoubtedly gone astray, unashamedly displaced by the interests of profit and power."
The implications are clear.
"In today's world, ""order"" reflects a balance of interests that is maintained mainly by force--be it military or financial."
"But something other than this ""order of the barracks"" is possible."
"Think of it as the order of the church choir, where individual members cooperate on the basis of a shared culture and values."
"One reason for the complete absence of values in ""power politics"" nowadays is that leaders get away with speaking words whose true meaning they leave out of their policies."
"Moreover, secular spiritual leaders like Gandhi, Schweitzer, and King have vanished, annihilated it seems by our new fetishes--success, expediency, gain, and special interests."
"Of course, the so-called civilized world never managed to create a living utopia."
Efforts to do so usually ended disastrously.
"As someone born in the old Soviet Union, I know firsthand the despair and brutality of such attempts."
This does not mean that all efforts to build a more moral world are doomed.
"Having survived an age of extreme ideologies, such as capitalism, communism, and, recently, market fundamentalism, most people no longer seek answers in ideological clichés and the driving, purifying force of political certainty."
"Forced harmonization is dead, which opens the door to making new voluntary forms of social harmony possible."
Let me suggest five steps necessary to begin to bring this about.
The first calls for the world to deem as utterly unacceptable state violence that seeks to impose conformity and discipline.
Such violence is unjust on its face because it suppresses and intimidates both body and spirit.
"To achieve this end, however, the state must be stripped of its ability to impose divisive dogmas, traditions, and stereotypes."
"That can happen only if a carefully crafted system of ""checks and balances"" is established, in which powerful organized interests--states, above all--are restrained in their efforts at dominance."
Not only political forces need to be checked.
"In the rush to concentrate wealth, for example, majority owners of corporations must not be allowed to harm the interests of minority shareholders, who as a rule are honest common citizens."
This leads me to my second reform priority: a systemic separation of state power and capital.
"Even in long-established democracies, candidates for elective office are not evaluated according to their wisdom and leadership, but according to the size of their campaign war chests."
Acquiring government power through possession of capital--and converting it into unjust economic rents--must be curtailed.
Can such a boundary between power and capital be set?
Yes.
"I say this as someone who created significant capital and, having done so, changed her occupation in order to cultivate morality in politics."
Laws can make the separation of capital and political power transparent for all to see.
"But the will to achieve this division is, sadly, absent among most people in power."
"Related to this, it is necessary to separate mass media from both power and the interests of capital."
"In Europe, America, and Japan, media ownership is increasingly concentrated, which rightly worries citizens in these countries, particularly when media owners move from forming opinion to forming governments."
"How much more worrying, then, is such concentrated ownership in new democracies and developing countries, where the check of civil society is mostly absent?"
All these reforms presuppose an independent judiciary.
"The autonomy of judges must be assured, which requires that their character is such that people trust their decisions."
"In states where justice is bought by the rich and powerful, this may impossible, but individual judges can and do stand up to power."
"All citizens should support such judicial stalwarts, for their example can refashion an entire justice system."
"In essence, creating a more moral political order requires the removal of money a"
"Of course my proposed ""transformations"" may sound too good to be possible."
"In defense I wish to cite the great Harvard philosopher John Rawls, who died recently."
"Theory, no matter how elegant, Rawls argued, should be dismissed or revised when proven untrue."
The corollary to this is that institutions and even world orders--no matter how efficient and successful--must be reformed if they are unjust.
Perhaps only someone who comes from one of the post-Soviet states can conceive of politics in terms of original principles in the manner of Rawls.
"Our newborn states were given the opportunity to create moral political systems on the ruins of a ""god that failed."""
"The struggle to do so has been mighty, but despite our travails--and our poverty--I believe that my country has the strength to contribute creatively to this endeavour."
After the Golden Age of Finance
"LONDON – Even after the passage of new financial regulations in the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act, and the publication of the Basel Committee’s new capital requirements, the financial sector’s prospects over the next few years remain highly uncertain."
"There has been some recovery in prices for bank shares from the lows of 2008, of course, but that rally faltered recently."
"Quite apart from their concerns about the robustness of the rebound in the economy, investors are uncertain about many financial firms’ business models, and about the future size, shape, and profitability of the financial sector in general."
"After all, banks remain deeply unpopular in all developed countries."
"Bankers are still social pariahs, as lowly valued by the public as drug dealers or journalists."
"They are reviled if they lose money, and assailed if they make it."
"For banks and their shareholders, it looks a case of heads they win, tails we lose."
"Thus, as banks return to profitability, politicians in North America and Europe have begun to talk again about new taxes that would skim those profits off to the benefit of taxpayers, whose support kept banks in business at the height of the crisis."
This is a huge contrast with the financial sector’s position in the previous three decades.
"From the late 1970’s until 2007, the financial sector grew far more rapidly than the real economy."
"In 1980, financial assets – stocks, bonds, and bank deposits – totaled around 100% of GDP in the advanced economies."
"By 2007, the figure was over 400% in the US, the United Kingdom, and Japan."
"During this period, credit expanded rapidly as a share of GDP, reaching more than 300% at the peak."
"In the UK, the profits of financial intermediaries, which had averaged around 1.5% of the whole economy’s profits in the 1970’s, reached 15% in 2008."
"In the US, bank profits were an even larger share of the total."
This was the golden age of finance.
"Bankers’ pay soared alongside profits – indeed, it grew even faster."
"To paraphrase William Wordsworth, bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, and to be a derivatives trader was very heaven."
"But the expansion came to a shuddering halt in 2008, the first year in decades in which aggregate financial assets fell, and there is still little sign of a sustained recovery."
Is this a short-term phenomenon?
Will the financial sector return to pre-crisis growth rates when the economic situation has been fully stabilized?
Will financial “deepening” continue?
Will bank stocks once again outperform the market?
A recent study by Andy Haldane and others at the Bank of England casts doubt on the prospect of a return to the status quo ante.
"They note that the Golden Age was in fact an unusual period, if you look at the last two centuries of economic history."
Haldane bases his analysis on the trend in the Gross Value Added (GVA) of the financial sector.
"Over the last 160 years, the GVA of finance has grown by two percentage points a year faster than that of the economy as a whole."
But this excess growth has not been evenly spread.
"During the two decades leading up to World War I, the financial sector grew almost four times faster than the economy, in the first wave of financial deepening and globalization, but from 1918 until the 1970’s, finance expanded less rapidly than average economic growth."
Only when markets were deregulated and liberalized from the early 1970’s onwards did finance once again leap ahead.
"In the US, financial sector GVA was only 2% of the total in the 1950s, but stands at 8% today."
Haldane believes that this growth spurt is well and truly over.
"He argues that much of the apparent growth in value added has in fact been illusory, based on increased leverage, excess trading, and banks writing deep out-of-the-money options – for example, credit-default swaps (a $60 trillion market in 2007)."
"“What all these strategies had in common,” writes Haldane, “was that they involved banks assuming risk in the hunt for yield – risk that was often disguised because it was parked in the tail of the return distribution.”"
"From a regulator’s perspective, this is a powerful argument for requiring higher capital to constrain the risk that banks can take on."
"Indeed, the Basel Committee plans to require more capital in the future, though the new requirements will be delayed, owing to concerns about the cost and availability of credit to sustain the recovery."
"Against that background, it is hard to believe that we will quickly return to the heady growth in financial assets, credit, and risk we saw from the 1970’s to 2007."
Financial-sector returns are likely to be lower.
Returns of 20% on equity targets are a thing of the past.
And lower profitability will reduce pay more effectively than any direct regulatory controls.
"For most of us, unless we remain seriously overweight in financial stocks, this may not be a bad prospect."
We do not want to inflate another asset-price bubble on the scale of the one that burst in 2007-2008.
But there is a risk for regulators and central banks.
"If they over-constrain the financial sector, risk may migrate outside the regulatory frontier, where it will be harder to measure and monitor."
"That is why it is important to maintain some flexibility, to allow currently unregulated institutions like hedge funds and private-equity funds to be swept into the regulatory net if they become large and systemically important."
"The tighter their controls on risk in banks, the more frontier police the regulators will need."
After the Greek Default
"CAMBRIDGE – The Greek government, the European Commission, and the International Monetary Fund are all denying what markets perceive clearly: Greece will eventually default on its debts to its private and public creditors."
"The politicians prefer to postpone the inevitable by putting public money where private money will no longer go, because doing so allows creditors to maintain the fiction that the accounting value of the Greek bonds that they hold need not be reduced."
"That, in turn, avoids triggering requirements of more bank capital."
"But, even though the additional loans that Greece will soon receive from the European Union and the IMF carry low interest rates, the level of Greek debt will rise rapidly to unsustainable levels."
That’s why market interest rates on privately held Greek bonds and prices for credit-default swaps indicate that a massive default is coming.
"And a massive default, together with a very large sustained cut in the annual budget deficit, is, in fact, needed to restore Greek fiscal sustainability."
"More specifically, even if a default brings the country’s debt down to 60% of GDP, Greece would still have to reduce its annual budget deficit from the current 10% of GDP to about 3% if it is to prevent the debt ratio from rising again."
"In that case, Greece should be able to finance its future annual government deficits from domestic sources alone."
But fiscal sustainability is no cure for Greece’s chronically large trade deficit.
"Greece’s imports now exceed its exports by more than 4% of its GDP, the largest trade deficit among eurozone member countries."
"If that trade gap persists, Greece will have to borrow the full amount from foreign lenders every year in the future, even if the post-default budget deficits could be financed by borrowing at home."
Eliminating or reducing this trade gap without depressing economic activity and employment in Greece requires that the country export more and import less.
"That, in turn, requires making Greek goods and services more competitive relative to those of the country’s trading partners."
A country with a flexible currency can achieve that by allowing the exchange rate to depreciate.
But Greece’s membership in the eurozone makes that impossible.
"So Greece faces the difficult task of lowering the prices of its goods and services relative to those in other countries by other means, namely a large cut in the wages and salaries of Greek private-sector employees."
"But, even if that could be achieved, it would close the trade gap only for as long as Greek prices remained competitive."
"To maintain price competitiveness, the gap between Greek wage growth and the rise in Greek productivity – i.e., output per employee hour – must not be greater than the gap in other eurozone countries."
That will not be easy.
Greece’s trade deficit developed over the past decade because Greek prices have been rising faster than those of its trading partners.
"And that has happened precisely because wages have been rising faster in Greece, relative to productivity growth, than in other eurozone countries."
"To see why it will be difficult for Greece to remain competitive, assume that the rest of the eurozone experiences annual productivity gains of 2%, while monetary policy limits annual price inflation to 2%."
"In that case, wages in the rest of the eurozone can rise by 4% a year."
"But if productivity in Greece rises at just 1%, Greek wages can increase at only 3%."
Any higher rate would cause Greek prices to rise more rapidly than those of its eurozone trading partners.
So Greece faces a triple challenge: the fiscal challenge of cutting its government debt and future deficits; the price-level challenge of reducing its prices enough to wipe out the current trade gap; and the wage-productivity challenge of keeping future wage growth below the eurozone average or raising its productivity growth rate.
"Ever since the Greek crisis began, the country has shown that it cannot solve its problems as the IMF and the European Commission had hoped."
"The countries that faced similar problems in other parts of the world always combined fiscal contractions with currency devaluations, which membership in a monetary union rules out."
"A temporary leave of absence from the eurozone would allow Greece to achieve a price-level decline relative to other eurozone countries, and would make it easier to adjust the relative price level if Greek wages cannot be limited."
"The Maastricht treaty explicitly prohibits a eurozone country from leaving the euro, but says nothing about a temporary leave of absence (and therefore doesn’t prohibit one)."
"It is time for Greece, other eurozone members, and the European Commission to start thinking seriously about that option."
After the Guns of August
The Middle East is a place where the dust hardly ever settles.
"When it occasionally does, even for a short interval – as UN Resolution 1701 for cessation of hostilities in Lebanon seems to be holding – it is time to take stock of events in the hopes that a responsible debate may influence those in power."
Let’s start with the United States.
President George W. Bush has been short on neither initiatives nor catchy slogans and acronyms.
"Recent years are littered with them: “Global War on Terror” (GWOT), “Road Map,” “Middle East Partnership Initiative “ (MEPI), “Broader Middle East and North Africa” (BMENA) – originally “Greater Middle East Initiative (GMEI) – Democracy Assisted Dialogue (DAD), and so on."
"His latest reverie, envisioned in the thick of the recent fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, was the New Middle East (NME), with US clients Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia serving as the pillars of regional order."
"But like all his previous initiatives since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington almost five years ago now, the NME ran into trouble from the outset."
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced its birth while rejecting an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon.
"Her poor timing made the initiative appear heartless, as thousands of civilians were being uprooted, killed, or maimed by Israel’s efficient but ruthless artillery and air force."
This so embarrassed the three Arab NME partners that each raced to distance itself from the US-sponsored initiative.
"Saudi Arabia, which had remained silent for nearly two weeks, did so with a $500 million contribution to rebuilding devastated areas of Lebanon and another billion to support Lebanon’s threatened currency."
Egypt’s heir apparent Gamal Mubarak followed suit in the fourth week of the fighting by heading a 70-member delegation on a solidarity visit to Beirut.
"But, rather than earning him the respect of an outraged Egyptian public, revelations in the opposition press that his plane had to obtain a safe passage and authority to land from the Israelis garnered only howls of derision."
"As for America, anything it touches in the Middle East has become radioactive, even for longstanding clients and friends."
"In the course of maneuvering to delay the UN ceasefire, Bush and Rice continually reiterated the need for a Security Council resolution that deals forcefully with “the roots of the problem.”"
"Of course, for them and for Israel, this was Hezbollah and the need to eradicate or at a minimum disarm it and force its fighters to a safe distance from settlements and towns in northern Israel."
"While this is a reasonable demand, the rest of the Middle East – and, indeed, much of the world, including Europe – regard the root cause of the conflict as Israeli intransigence and arrogance, together with America’s blind support for it."
"Both America and Israel have cited foot-dragging in implementing UN Resolution 1559, which calls for disarming all non-state actors in Lebanon and the deployment of government forces all the way to the southern border."
"But for years the US and Israel have not uttered a word about the dozens of UN resolutions, going back as far as Resolution 49 on partition in 1947, which called for the establishment of distinct Arab and Jewish states on roughly half of Mandated Palestine."
This and numerous other resolutions seeking redress for injustices toward Palestinians have been ignored by the US.
"Thus, for 300 million Arabs and more than one billion Muslims the “root cause” of the Middle East conflict is not Hezbollah."
"As its leader, Hassan Nasrallah aptly put it, “We are just a reaction to chronic injustice.”"
It may well be that there is more than one root cause – every party to the conflict has a favorite one.
There is no point in belaboring whose pain is greater or whose root cause is deeper.
"In fact, arguing over grievances merely drives the sides further apart."
"The long overdue UN Resolution 1701 may, with its adoption, indicate that all parties are fatigued, or could no longer withstand international pressure."
This is good news for all concerned and provides an opportunity to tackle each party’s “root cause.”
Seizing the opportunity requires that humility rather than moral supremacy prevails.
"Empathy, not ethnocentrism, should be the order of the day now that the guns are falling silent and we have rediscovered the limits of military force."
"But if we have learned anything at all from the tragic assassinations of the region’s greatest peacemakers, Anwar Sadat and Yitzhak Rabin, it is that the guns do not remain silent for long."
"During any lull, a fanatic from either side could jump to center stage and, through an act of utter madness, kick up the settling dust and dash the hopes of the many on both sides who still long for a lasting peace."
After the Millennium Development Goal
"CAMBRIDGE – In 2000, 189 countries collectively adopted the United Nations Millennium Declaration, which evolved into a set of concrete targets called the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)."
These ambitious targets – ranging from halving extreme poverty and reducing maternal mortality by three-quarters to achieving universal primary schooling and halting (and beginning to reverse) the spread of HIV/AIDS – are supposed to be met by the end of 2015.
"As the deadline approaches, development experts are debating a new question: What comes next?"
"It is virtually certain that many of the MDGs will not have been met by the end of 2015, but there have been striking successes in some areas."
"For example, the goal of halving extreme poverty (measured by the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day) will likely be achieved ahead of time, largely thanks to China’s phenomenal growth."
"At the same time, there is little evidence to suggest that those successes were the result of the MDGs themselves."
"China implemented the policies that engineered history’s greatest poverty eradication program prior to, and independently from, the Millennium Declaration and the MDGs."
"Clearly, however, the MDGs were a public-relations triumph, which is not to belittle their contribution."
"Like all worthwhile PR efforts, the MDGs served to raise awareness, galvanize attention, and mobilize action – all for a good cause."
They amplified the global conversation about development and defined its terms. And there is evidence that they got advanced countries to pay more attention to poor nations.
"Indeed, the MDGs possibly had their clearest impact on aid flows from rich to poor countries."
"A study by Charles Kenny and Andy Sumner for the Center for Global Development in Washington, DC, suggests that the MDGs not only boosted aid flows, but also redirected them toward smaller, poorer countries, and toward targeted areas like education and public health."
"However, aid was not directly linked to performance and results, and it is much more difficult to know whether it had the desired impact overall."
"The MDGs encompass eight goals, 21 targets, and 60 indicators."
"Much criticism has focused on the use of these numerical targets and indicators, which, skeptics argue, are misspecified, mismeasured, and divert attention from equally important areas."
"But these complaints miss the point. Any effort that is concrete and implementable needs to monitor the results, and setting clear numerical targets is the best way to do so."
"Still, a central paradox plagues the MDGs."
"The Millennium Declaration was meant to be a compact between the world’s rich and poor countries. Poor countries promised to refocus their development efforts while rich countries pledged to support them with finance, technology, and access to their markets."
"But, oddly, of the eight goals, only the last one deals with “global partnership,” or what rich countries can and should do."
"Even here, the MDGs contain no numerical target for financial aid or any other aspect of rich countries’ assistance, in contrast to the highly specific poverty-related targets set for developing countries."
"It is perhaps telling that the “progress charts” prepared by the United Nations Development Program, the agency charged with reporting on progress toward achieving the MDGs, track only Internet usage under that goal."
Why we need a global effort to convince developing countries to do what is good for them is not clear.
"Poverty reduction and human development should be the first order of business for governments in these countries, with or without the MDGs."
"It is true, of course, that these governments often pursue different goals, for political, military, and other reasons."
But it is wishful thinking to believe that they can be persuaded to act otherwise by international declarations that lack enforcement mechanisms.
"If we have learned one thing in the development business, it is that real reform cannot be bought with donors’ money, let alone with vague promises of money."
"Equally problematic, the MDGs implicitly assume that we know how to achieve development targets, and that only resources and political will are missing."
"But it is doubtful that even well-intentioned policymakers have a good handle on, say, how to raise secondary-school completion rates sustainably or reduce maternal mortality."
Many development economists would argue that significant improvements in governance and political institutions are required before such goals can be achieved. The most that rich countries can do is to provide an enabling environment for the benefit of developing countries that are willing and able to take advantage of it.
