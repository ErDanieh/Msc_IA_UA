"But if America’s next president is committed to a new direction, US foreign policy might again become more multilateral, more focused on international institutions and alliances, and willing to bring the relationship between military force and diplomacy back to within its historical proportions."
That is the good news.
"The bad news is that, even under such auspicious conditions, the US, as a world power, will not relinquish its “free-hand” policy or forget its strength and its claim to preeminence among nations."
"Another piece of bad (or good?) news is that a more multilateral American policy will increase the pressure on Europeans to take on more responsibility for international crisis management and conflict resolution – in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, the Middle East, Transcaucasia, and Russia, and with respect to Turkey’s future."
"To this common agenda, the Europeans should add Africa, climate change, and reform of the United Nations and the world trading system."
"For a long time, Europe has underestimated its weight and importance."
"Europe’s geopolitical, economic, and social weight is quite obvious."
But Europe’s integration of sovereign states’ interests by means of common institutions could also be an example for much of the world.
"In particular, the way Europe, in the process of its enlargement, has projected its power to achieve lasting peace across the whole continent, and fostered development by integrating entire economies, states, and societies within its institutional framework, could become a model for shaping a cooperative world order in the twenty-first century."
"This modern, progressive, and peaceful model is unique and superior to all other currently available approaches to the fundamental questions of political order."
But could doesn’t mean will.
"Europe’s global influence is feeble because of its internal quarrels and lack of unity, which render the European Union weak and limit its ability to act."
"Objectively strong, subjectively infirm – that is how the EU’s present condition can be described."
"The current moment of American weakness coincides with a substantially changed international political environment, defined largely by the limits of US power, Europe’s ineffectiveness, and the emergence of new global giants like China and India."
"In light of these developments, does it still make sense to speak of “the West”?"
"I believe it does, more than ever, because the rift between Europe and America leaves both sides substantially weaker in global terms."
The unilateral overstretching of American power offers a chance for a new beginning in US-European relations.
"America, more than in the past, will depend on strong partners and will seek such partnerships."
So what are the Europeans waiting for?
Why not start now to overcome the traditional tension between NATO and the EU – especially as French policy toward NATO under President Nicolas Sarkozy has been moving in the right direction?
A regular mutual presence of the Secretary General of NATO and of the head of EU foreign policy in the councils of both organizations doesn’t require much time and effort.
"Why not initiate EU-US consultations at a high political level (with the Secretary-General of NATO participating in security matters) – for instance, by inviting the US Secretary of State and other members of the administration, such as the Treasury Secretary or the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to sit several times a year on the appropriate EU Council meetings?"
Why not have routine annual meetings between the European Council and the US President?
"Periodic meetings between the appropriate committees of the US Congress and the European Parliament would also be of great importance, as ultimately both bodies will have to ratify any international treaties."
The fate of the Kyoto Protocol should be a lesson to all parties involved.
"No such US-EU consultations would require any new agreements, so they could start without any further preliminaries."
"There is one certainty that Europeans can take home from the US election campaign even today: with a more multilaterally oriented US foreign policy, Europe won’t be riding comfortably in the US world-political slipstream much longer."
And that is a good thing.
The new transatlantic formula must be greater say in decision-making in exchange for a greater share of responsibility.
America at Stall Speed?
"NEWPORT BEACH – Judging from the skittishness of both markets and “consensus expectations,” the United States’ economic prospects are confusing."
"One day, the country is on the brink of a double-dip recession; the next, it is on the verge of a turbo-charged recovery, powered by resilient consumers and US multinationals starting to deploy, at long last, their massive cash reserves."
"In the process, markets take investors on a wild rollercoaster ride, with the European crisis (riddled with even more confusion and volatility) serving to aggravate their queasiness."
This situation is both understandable and increasingly unsettling for America’s well-being and that of the global economy.
"It reflects the impact of fundamental (and historic) economic and financial re-alignments, insufficient policy responses, and system-wide rigidities that frustrate structural change."
"As a result, there are now legitimate questions about the underlying functioning of the US economy and, therefore, its evolution in the months and years ahead."
One way to understand current conditions – and what is needed to improve them – is to consider two events that recently attracted considerable worldwide attention: the launch of Boeing’s Dreamliner passenger jet and the tragic death of Apple’s Steve Jobs.
"Let us start with some simple aeronautic dynamics, using an analogy that my PIMCO colleague, Bill Gross, came up with to describe the economic risks facing the American economy."
"For the Dreamliner to take off, ascend, and maintain a steady altitude, it must do more than move forward."
"It has to move forward fast enough to exceed critical physical thresholds, which are significantly higher than those for most of Boeing’s other (smaller) planes."
"Failure would mean succumbing to a mid-air stall, with tepid forward motion giving way to a sudden loss of altitude."
"Unless we are convinced of the Dreamliner’s ability to avoid stall speed, it makes no sense to talk about all the ways in which it will enhance the travel experience for millions of people around the world."
America’s economy today risks stall speed.
"Specifically, the question is not whether it can grow, but whether it can grow fast enough to propel a large economy that, according to the US Federal Reserve, faces “balance-sheet deleveraging, credit constraints, and household and business uncertainty about the economic outlook.”"
"And, remember, it is just over a year since certain US officials were proclaiming the economy’s “summer of recovery” – a view underpinned by the erroneous belief that America was reaching “escape velocity.”"
"Stall speed is a terrifying risk for an economy like that of the US, which desperately needs to grow robustly."
"Without rapid growth, there is no way to reverse persistently high and increasingly structural (and therefore protracted) unemployment; safely de-leverage over-indebted balance sheets; and prevent already-disturbing income and wealth inequalities from growing worse."
The private sector alone cannot and will not counter the risk of stall speed.
What is desperately needed is better policymaking.
"Specifically, policymakers must be open and willing to understand the unusual challenges facing the US economy, react accordingly, and possess sufficiently potent policy instruments."
"Unfortunately, this has been far from the case in America (and in Europe, where the situation is worse)."
"Moreover, US policymakers in the last few weeks have been more interested in pointing fingers at Europe and China than in recognizing and responding to the paradigm shifts that are at the root of the country’s economic problems and mounting social challenges."
"This is where the insights of Steve Jobs, one of the world’s best innovators and entrepreneurs, come in."
Jobs did more than navigate paradigm shifts; he essentially created them.
"He was a master at converting the complicated into the simple; and, rather than being paralyzed by complexity, he found new ways to deconstruct and overcome it."
"Teamwork was an obligation, not a choice."
And he eschewed the search for the single “big bang” in favor of aiming for multiple breakthroughs.
Underlying it all was a willingness to evolve – a drive for perfection through experimentation.
"Moreover, he excelled at selling to audiences worldwide both his vision and his strategy for realizing it."
"So far, America’s economic policymakers have fallen short on all of these fronts."
"Rather than committing to a comprehensive set of urgently-needed reinforcing measures, they seem obsessed with the futile search for the one “killer app” that will solve all of the country's economic problems."
No surprise that they have yet to find it.
Teamwork has repeatedly fallen hostage to turf wars and political bickering.
"Little has been done to deconstruct structural complexity, let alone win sufficient public support for a medium-term vision, a credible implementation strategy, and a set of measures that is adequate to the task at hand."
"The longer the policymaking impasse persists, the greater the stall-speed risk for an economy that already has an unemployment crisis, a large budget deficit, many underwater mortgages, and policy interest rates floored at zero."
"This is an atmosphere in which unhealthy balance sheets come under even greater pressure, and healthy investors refuse to engage."
"In the process, the risk of recession remains uncomfortably high, the unemployment crisis deepens, and inequities rise as already-stretched social safety nets prove even more porous."
"America, China, and the Productivity Paradox"
"NEW HAVEN – In the late 1980s, there was intense debate about the so-called productivity paradox – when massive investments in information technology (IT) were not delivering measureable productivity improvements."
"That paradox is now back, posing a problem for both the United States and China – one that may well come up in their annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue."
"Back in 1987, Nobel laureate Robert Solow famously quipped, “You can see the computer age everywhere except in the productivity statistics.”"
"The productivity paradox seemed to be resolved in the 1990s, when America experienced a spectacular productivity renaissance."
"Average annual productivity growth in the country’s nonfarm business sector accelerated to 2.5% from 1991 to 2007, from the 1.5% trend in the preceding 15 years."
The benefits of the Internet Age had finally materialized.
Concern about the paradox all but vanished.
But the celebration appears to have been premature.
"Despite another technological revolution, productivity growth is slumping again. And this time the downturn is global in scope, affecting the world’s two largest economies, the US and China, most of all."
"Over the past five years, from 2010 to 2014, annual US productivity growth has fallen to an average of 0.9%."
It actually fell at a 2.6% annual rate in the two most recent quarters (in late 2014 and early 2015).
"Barring a major data revision, America’s productivity renaissance seems to have run into serious trouble."
China is witnessing a similar pattern.
"Although the government does not publish regular productivity statistics, there is no mistaking the problem: Overall urban employment growth has been steady, at around 13.2 million workers per year since 2013 – well in excess of the government’s targeted growth rate of ten million."
"Moreover, hiring seems to be holding at that brisk pace in early 2015."
"At the same time, output growth has slowed from the 10% trend of the 33 years ending in 2011 to around 7% today."
"That downshift, in the face of sustained rapid job creation, implies an unmistakable deceleration of productivity."
Therein lies the latest paradox.
"With revolutionary technologies now driving the creation of new markets (digital media and computerized wearables), services (energy management and DNA sequencing), products (smartphones and robotics), and technology companies (Alibaba and Apple), surely productivity growth must be surging."
"As a modern-day Solow might say, the “Internet of Everything” is everywhere except in the productivity statistics."
But is there really a paradox?
"Northwestern University’s Robert Gordon has argued that IT- and Internet-led innovations like automated high-speed data processing and e-commerce pale in comparison to the breakthroughs of the Industrial Revolution, including the steam engine, electricity, and indoor plumbing."
"He maintains that, although these innovations led to dramatic transformations of the major advanced economies – such as higher female labor-force participation, increased transportation speed, urbanization, and normalized temperature control – these changes will be extremely hard to replicate."
"Indeed, as taken with today’s revolutionary technologies as we are – I say this staring at my sleek new Apple Watch – I am sympathetic to Gordon’s argument."
If US productivity figures are to be taken at anything close to face value – a persistently sluggish trend interrupted by a 16-year spurt that now appears to have faded – it is possible that all America has accomplished are transitional efficiency improvements associated with the IT-enabled shift from one technology platform to another.
"Optimists maintain that the official statistics fail to capture marked quality-of-life improvements, which may be true, especially in the light of promising advances in biotechnology and online education. But this overlooks a much more important aspect of the productivity-measurement critique: the undercounting of work time associated with the widespread use of portable information appliances."
"In the US, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the length of the average workweek has held steady at about 34 hours since the advent of the Internet two decades ago."
"Yet nothing could be further from the truth: knowledge workers continually toil outside the traditional office, checking their email, updating spreadsheets, writing reports, and engaging in collective brainstorming."
"Indeed, white-collar knowledge workers – that is, most workers in advanced economies – are now tethered to their workplaces essentially 24 hours a day, seven days a week, a reality that is not reflected in the official statistics."
Productivity growth is not about working longer; it is about generating more output per unit of labor input.
Any undercounting of output pales in comparison with the IT-assisted undercounting of working hours.
China’s productivity slowdown is probably more benign.
It is an outgrowth of the Chinese economy’s nascent structural transformation from capital-intensive manufacturing to labor-intensive services.
"Indeed, it was only in 2013 that services supplanted manufacturing and construction as the economy’s largest sector."
"Now the gap is widening, and that is likely to continue."
"With Chinese services requiring about 30% more workers per unit of output than manufacturing and construction, combined, the economy’s structural rebalancing is now shifting growth to China’s lower-productivity services sector."
China has time before this becomes a problem.
"As Gordon notes, there have been long-lasting productivity dividends associated with urbanization – a trend that could continue for at least another decade in China. But there will come a time when this tailwind subsides and China begins to converge on the so-called frontier of the advanced economies."
"At that point, China will face the same productivity challenges that confront America and others."
Chinese policymakers’ new focus on innovation-led growth seems to recognize this risk.
"Without powerful innovations, sustaining productivity growth will be an uphill battle."
China’s recent shift to a slower-productivity trajectory is an early warning of what may well be one of its most daunting economic challenges.
There is no escaping the key role that productivity growth plays in any country’s economic performance.
"Yet, for advanced economies, periods of sustained rapid productivity growth have been the exception, not the rule."
Recent signs of slowing productivity growth in both the US and China underscore this reality.
"For a world flirting with secular stagnation, that is disturbing news, to say the least."
A New Blueprint for US-China Relation
"NEW YORK – In the coming decades, nothing will matter more for global peace, prosperity, and governance than how the United States and China handle the ongoing shift in their relative power."
"In the long term, today’s other pressing challenges – including Russia’s relationship with the West and events in the tumultuous Middle East – will amount almost to sideshows by comparison."
What makes the Sino-American relationship dangerous is that powerful forces in both countries seem intent on a collision course.
"On the Chinese side, under Xi Jinping’s assertive leadership, the government is no longer heeding Deng Xiaoping’s injunction that the country should “hide its strength, bide its time, and never take the lead” in international affairs."
"It has pursued manifestly expansionist territorial claims, most notably in the South China Sea, and shown a clear determination to resist the indefinite continuation of American dominance in the region."
"The prevailing Chinese mindset is that the US is intent on isolating, containing, and undermining it."
"Unhappily, there is plenty of evidence on the US side to feed that sentiment."
"Whatever many American policymakers may be saying in private, their public discourse almost invariably reflects an intention to remain the world’s dominant power – and specifically in Asia – in perpetuity."
"The most confrontational recent articulation of this position can be found in a report for the Council on Foreign Relations, by Robert Blackwill and Ashley Tellis, arguing that the central objective of American grand strategy must be “preserving US primacy in the global system,” and urging a series of aggressive economic, political, and military measures to “balance” China."
"They say this is not a “containment” strategy, but it amounts to nothing less."
"Is there another way to manage the relationship that, while reflecting the reality of these forces and mindsets on both sides, would not risk turning legitimate competition into dangerous confrontation?"
"In a new report for the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Kevin Rudd, former Australian Prime Minister and now head of the Asia Society Policy Institute, outlines just such a strategy, which he calls “constructive realism”."
"It’s a clunky label, but his analysis and policy prescriptions are compelling."
"The “realist” dimension of Rudd’s argument recognizes that certain areas of disagreement – including Taiwan, territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas, US alliances in Asia, Chinese military modernization, and the legitimacy of China’s political system – will remain intractable for the foreseeable future."
They will defy easy solutions – and thus will require very careful management.
"The “constructive” part of Rudd’s thesis argues for systematic collaboration – with the US treating China more as an equal – in tackling a series of other difficult issues at bilateral, regional, and global levels."
"Bilaterally, such cooperation might involve an investment treaty, a joint intelligence task force on terrorism, a cyber-security protocol, agreed measures for managing unplanned military incidents, and mutual ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty."
"On a regional level, Rudd argues, the US and China could work on joint strategies to denuclearize and, ultimately, reunify the Korean Peninsula; tackle the lingering sore of Japan’s war history; harmonize regional trade agreements; and transform the East Asia Summit into a more complete Asia-Pacific Community."
"Globally, Rudd believes that the joint agenda could focus on combating climate change, revitalizing the G-20, further internationalizing the renminbi; giving China a greater role in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank; and reforming other key international institutions within the UN system."
"Some in the West – including veteran China watcher David Shambaugh – remain convinced that this kind of collaborative accommodation will not be necessary, because failures of economic and political management will bring about China’s implosion."
"Rudd argues that they are wrong, and that Xi will neither overplay his authoritarian hand nor under-deliver on growth."
"China’s rise will continue, and the world – including the US – will have to find principled ways of peacefully accommodating it."
"Rudd’s recommendations are undoubtedly ambitious. But, given his credentials – he is a formidable Chinese linguist and creative policy thinker, with long and close personal relationships with key figures in both the US and China – his argument must be taken seriously."
"Indeed, though Rudd’s tenure as Australia’s prime minister was anything but smooth, his sheer force of intellect is unmatched by that of any public figure with whom I have interacted over the last 30 years."
(Not that this will much help his evident willingness to be drafted as the next UN Secretary-General: in that role the major powers have always preferred bland secretaries to creative generals.)
No American presidential candidate is likely to be comfortable talking about the US as anything other than Number One.
But we must hope that in the years ahead we hear less talk of “primacy” and “dominance” and much more about cooperation and collaboration.
"It is only with such US policies toward China that the world can begin to be confident that the twenty-first century will not, like the last, become a vale of tears."
America Confronts Old and New Europe
"US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's petulant remark of last year about ""old and new Europe"" was right for the wrong reasons."
"He meant it to refer to Europe's divisions, but in May, ten additional states joined the European Union."
The expanded Europe truly forms a new Europe.
Should America be nervous?
"Fifty-four years after the announcement of the Schuman Plan that began to knit together the economies of France and Germany, the EU now has 25 countries and a population larger than that of the United States."
Eight of the new members are former Communist countries that were locked behind the Iron Curtain for nearly half a century.
"Their attraction to the Union is a sign of the appeal - the ""soft power"" - of the idea of European unification."
"Of course, this new Europe faces many problems."
The per capita income of the new countries is less than half of that of the fifteen members they are joining.
"Concerns have been raised about the influx of cheap labor. But average GDP growth rates in the new members are twice as high as in the original members, and this can provide a welcome stimulus to stagnant labor markets and sluggish economies."
Political arrangements are somewhat more problematic.
Negotiations are underway to revise a draft EU constitution.
Some Europeans worry that the constitution will enable courts to carry the integration process further and faster than public opinion in member states will tolerate.
"Lack of grassroots support might lead to rejection of the constitution in countries like Britain, where referenda have been promised before the new arrangements come into force."
"But some express concern that the new Europe will be defined in opposition to the US. Not only do the remarks of French leaders about recreating a multi-polar world arouse alarm, but recent public opinion polls show a decline in the popularity of the US among Europeans and a desire for more independent policies."
"The Iraq War proved costly to American soft power, with the US losing about 30 percentage points of attractiveness on average in Europe, including in countries like Britain, Spain, and Italy, whose governments supported the war."
The recent photographs of detainees being abused and sexually degraded in Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison added fuel to the fire.
Now some American neo-conservatives argue that the US should drop its longstanding support for European integration.
Such a policy change would be a serious mistake.
"Not only would it add to anti-American attitudes and fail to accomplish its objectives, but it over-estimates the extent to which the new Europe is being formed in opposition to the US. Whatever the rhetoric in France, for example, the policies and attitudes in countries such as Britain or Poland demonstrate that good trans-Atlantic relations can be maintained."
"If anything, the risks of a US-Europe split will be reduced rather than increased by the EU's recent enlargement."
"Moreover, there are several objective reasons why the current friction between Europe and the US is unlikely to lead to divorce."
"For one thing, the divisive war in Iraq may turn out to be the last act of the twentieth century rather than a harbinger of the twenty-first."
"American unilateralism is much less in evidence in the world's other hot spots, such as North Korea and Iran, both because of the costs of the war in Iraq and the realities of the situation in those other regions."
"Moreover, while the common security threat from the Soviet Union has disappeared, both the US and Europe face a new common threat from radical"
Europe and America also share a common structure of economic interests and values.
"While trade produces frictions in democracies, it also enhances wealth."
"If one looks at foreign direct investment, it is clear that the two sides of the Atlantic are closely integrated."
"In terms of values, while some differences exist between Europe and America, at the fundamental level of democracy and human rights, no other two parts of the globe share more."
"As the writer Robert Kagan concluded in the revision of his book in which he declared Europeans to be from Venus and Americans from Mars, it turns out that Americans seeking democratic legitimization of their policies and self-images cannot escape Europe."
"In short, it is good for Americans - and for the world - that old and new Europe are becoming one."
We can all benefit from the soft power of an enlarged Europe.
America Goes from Teacher to Student
"Cambridge &#45;&#45; As the United States’ epic financial crisis continues to unfold, one can only wish that US policymakers were half as good at listening to advice from developing countries as they are at giving it."
Americans don’t seem to realize that their “sub-prime” mortgage meltdown has all too much in common with many previous post-1945 banking crises throughout the world.
"The silver lining is that there are many highly distinguished current and former policymakers out there, particularly from emerging market countries, who have seen this movie before."
"If US policymakers would only listen, they might get an idea or two about how to deal with financial crises from experts who have lived through them and come out safely on the other side."
"Unfortunately, the parallel between today’s US crisis and previous financial crises is not mere hyperbole."
"The qualitative parallels are obvious: banks using off-balance loans to finance highly risky ventures, exotic new financial instruments, and excessive exuberance over the promise of new markets."
But there are strong quantitative parallels as well.
Professor Carmen Reinhart of the University of Maryland and I systematically compared the run-up to the US sub-prime crisis with the run-up to the 19 worst financial crises in the industrialized world over the past 60 years.
"These include epic crises in the Scandinavian countries, Spain, and Japan, along with lesser events such as the US savings and loan crises of the 1980’s."
"Across virtually all the major indicators – including equity and housing price runs-ups, trade balance deficits, surges in government and household indebtedness, and pre-crisis growth trajectories – red lights are blinking for the US."
"Simply put, surging capital flows into the US artificially held down interest rates and inflated asset prices, leading to laxity in banking and regulatory standards and, ultimately, to a meltdown."
"When Asia and Latin America had their financial meltdowns in the 1990’s and early 2000’s, they took advice not only from the IMF, but also from a number of small panels composed of eminent people representing diverse backgrounds and experiences."
The US should do the same.
"The head of the IMF, Frenchman Dominique Strauss-Kahn, could easily select a superb panel from any range of former crisis countries, including Mexico, Brazil, Korea, Turkey, Japan, and Sweden, not to mention Argentina, Russia, Chile, and many others."
"Admittedly, the IMF’s panel would have to look past America’s current hypocrisy."
The US Treasury strongly encouraged Asia to tighten fiscal policy during its 1990’s crisis.
"But today the US Congress and President are tripping over themselves to adopt an ill-advised giant fiscal stimulus package, whose main effects will be to tie the hands of the next president in simplifying the US tax code and closing the budget deficit."
Americans firmly told Japan that the only way to clean up its economy was to purge insolvent banks and regenerate the financial system through Schumpeterian “creative destruction.”
"Today, US authorities appear willing to contemplate any measure, no matter how inflationary, to insure that none of its major banks and investment houses fails."
"For years, foreign governments complained about American hedge funds, arguing that their non-transparent behavior posed unacceptable risks to stability."
"Now, many US politicians are complaining about the transparency of sovereign wealth funds (big government investors mainly from Asia and the Middle East), which are taking shares in trophy American assets such as Citibank and Merrill Lynch."
"In fact, having countries like Russia and China more vested in the well-being of the US economy would not be a bad thing."
"Yes, the IMF ought to develop a voluntary code of conduct for SWF’s, but it should not be used as a weapon to enforce financial protectionism."
"For years, I, along with many others, have complained that emerging markets need greater representation in global financial governance."
"Today, the issue goes far beyond symbolism."
"The US economy is in trouble, and the problems it spins off are unlikely to stop at the US border."
Experts from emerging markets and elsewhere have much to say about dealing with financial crises.
America should start to listen before it is too late.
Alliances for Peace
"WASHINGTON, DC – I grew up in the shadow of World War II, and at the dawn of the Cold War."
"My father’s work as a Foreign Service officer gave me an opportunity to see history up close in a searing way: I will never forget walking the beaches of Normandy with him and seeing the burned hulks of Higgins’ boats still on those shores, just a few years after so many young men went to their graves so the world could be free."
"Likewise, I will never forget the eerie feeling of riding my bike through the Brandenburg Gate from West Berlin into the East, and seeing the contrast between people who were free and those who were trapped behind the Iron Curtain."
"What strikes me now, all these years later, is that a generation of leaders won not only a war, but also the peace."
"They did it together. The United States and our partners worked to create alliances that brought prosperity and stability to Western Europe, Japan, and South Korea."
"Old enemies became new allies, and together pioneered a new global economic system that made the world more prosperous."
"And even as the Cold War raged, leaders found ways to cooperate on arms control and prevent a nuclear Armageddon."
"In short, by building effective and indispensable international institutions and strategic partnerships, we did not just avoid another catastrophic world war; we ultimately ended the Cold War and lifted global living standards for hundreds of millions of people."
That is the remarkable story of the twentieth century.
The question now is what story will emerge from the twenty-first century.
Extremists who hijack religion threaten governments and people everywhere. Technology is accelerating a shift in the balance of power between governments and governed that offers both opportunities for democratic accountability and obstacles to inclusive politics.
We have gone from a world where power resided in hierarchies to one where it inhabits networks. Statecraft has yet to adapt.
The international institutions and partnerships that emerged in the postwar years demand both maintenance and modernization.
"In the face of all of this turbulence, some suggest that America should turn inward."
That is nothing new.
"Some argued the same after WWII. They argued it again 25 years ago, after the fall of the Berlin Wall."
They were wrong then – and they are wrong now.
"The need for leadership has never been greater, and the US has never been more engaged with the world."
"Our role in Afghanistan’s first-ever peaceful, democratic transition reminds us all that, having invested so much blood and treasure in helping to give Afghans a chance to succeed in battle, the world has just as much responsibility to help its leaders succeed in governance."
"We know that the destruction of 100% of Syria’s declared chemical weapons would not have happened without direct, hands-on diplomacy and perseverance, just as Syria’s immoral and horrifying civil war will not end without an equal commitment."
"So, too, in Asia, where President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping just announced ambitious commitments to tackle climate change, we are reminded of what countries can accomplish together with real leadership – and of how much additional leadership is required to conclude a successful climate agreement in Paris next year."
"The world has changed, and we are changing with it."
"Lines on the map no longer contain the gravest threats, and the players are no longer divided neatly into two camps."
"In the twenty-first century, next door is everywhere."
That is why the world needs coalition diplomacy.
No country can defeat terrorism on its own.
No country can solve the existential threat of climate change alone.
"No country can eradicate extreme poverty, combat potential pandemics, or improve nuclear security by itself."
"None of us can live safer, richer lives by turning our back to the world."
"We must build on our history of working with allies by forming new coalitions – with governments, with civil society, and, yes, with everyday people."
A good example is the international effort to confront the Islamic State’s malign brutality in Iraq and Syria.
"Political, humanitarian, and intelligence tools from more than 60 countries are being used to support unified military action."
"Success depends not on what one or even a handful of countries can do alone, but on what all of us are able to achieve by moving forward together against this common threat."
"On an equally important front, the US is working with the United Nations to galvanize a global response to the danger posed by the Ebola virus."
"I have personally talked with more than 50 foreign leaders, and we all agree that only by coordinating our actions can we stop the devastation in West Africa and halt Ebola’s spread."
"We are making progress on both issues, but much work remains."
Bringing together countries with competing interests and varying resources is hard work.
"It demands intense diplomatic engagement and calls upon relationships that have been built and maintained over decades, as well as alliances with new partners."
"But by overcoming differences and coordinating efforts to defeat the Islamic State and conquer Ebola, we are reinforcing support for a world order grounded in collective solutions to common problems."
Cooperation is equally vital in reinforcing the bedrock economic principles on which America and other countries built their postwar prosperity.
Frustration cannot grow faster than opportunity in any country.
"For example, the negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) reflect President Obama’s determination to strike an accord with countries that represent one-third of global trade and 40% of global GDP."
The benefits – for both the US and our partners – are enormous.
"Estimates are that the TPP could provide $77 billion a year in real income and support 650,000 new jobs in the US alone."
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership being negotiated with the European Union offers another major step toward increasing trade.
"Whether for mutual security or shared prosperity, genuine partnerships are not built overnight."
Patient diplomacy and a collective will are needed to advance common goals.
"America’s objectives remain the same as they have been for decades – peace, prosperity, and stability for the US and for our partners around the world."
Inequality and the American Child
"NEW YORK – Children, it has long been recognized, are a special group."
"They do not choose their parents, let alone the broader conditions into which they are born."
They do not have the same abilities as adults to protect or care for themselves.
"That is why the League of Nations approved the Geneva Declaration on the Rights of the Child in 1924, and why the international community adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989."
"Sadly, the United States is not living up to its obligations."
"In fact, it has not even ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child."
"The US, with its cherished image as a land of opportunity, should be an inspiring example of just and enlightened treatment of children."
"Instead, it is a beacon of failure – one that contributes to global sluggishness on children’s rights in the international arena."
"Though an average American childhood may not be the worst in the world, the disparity between the country’s wealth and the condition of its children is unparalleled."
"About 14.5% of the American population as a whole is poor, but 19.9% of children – some 15 million individuals – live in poverty. Among developed countries, only Romania has a higher rate of child poverty."
"The US rate is two-thirds higher than that in the United Kingdom, and up to four times the rate in the Nordic countries."
"For some groups, the situation is much worse: more than 38% of black children, and 30% of Hispanic children, are poor."
None of this is because Americans do not care about their children.
"It is because America has embraced a policy agenda in recent decades that has caused its economy to become wildly unequal, leaving the most vulnerable segments of society further and further behind."
"The growing concentration of wealth – and a significant reduction in taxes on it – has meant less money to spend on investments for the public good, like education and the protection of children."
"As a result, America’s children have become worse off."
Their fate is a painful example of how inequality not only undermines economic growth and stability – as economists and organizations like the International Monetary Fund are finally acknowledging – but also violates our most cherished notions of what a fair society should look like.
"Income inequality is correlated with inequalities in health, access to education, and exposure to environmental hazards, all of which burden children more than other segments of the population."
"Indeed, nearly one in five poor American children are diagnosed with asthma, a rate 60% higher than non-poor children."
"Learning disabilities occur almost twice as frequently among children in households earning less than $35,000 a year than they do in households earning more than $100,000."
"And some in the US Congress want to cut food stamps – on which some 23 million American households depend, threatening the poorest children with hunger."
These inequalities in outcomes are closely tied to inequalities in opportunities.
"Inevitably, in countries where children have inadequate nutrition, insufficient access to health care and education, and higher exposure to environmental hazards, the children of the poor will have far different life prospects from those of the rich."
"And, partly because an American child’s lifetime prospects are more dependent on his or her parents’ income and education than in other advanced countries, the US now has the least equality of opportunity of any advanced country."
"At America’s most elite universities, for example, only around 9% of students come from the bottom half of the population, while 74% come from the top quarter."
Most societies recognize a moral obligation to help ensure that young people can live up to their potential.
Some countries even impose a constitutional mandate for equality of educational opportunities.
"But in America, more is spent on the education of rich students than on the education of the poor."
"As a result, the US is wasting some of its most valuable assets, with some young people – bereft of skills – turning to dysfunctional activities."
American states like California spend about as much on prisons as on higher education – and sometimes more.
"Without compensatory measures – including pre-school education, ideally beginning at a very young age – unequal opportunities translate into unequal lifelong outcomes by the time children reach the age of five."
That should be a spur to policy action.
"Indeed, while inequality’s harmful effects are wide-reaching, and impose huge costs on our economies and societies, they are largely avoidable."
The extremes of inequality observed in some countries are not the inexorable result of economic forces and laws.
"The right policies – stronger social safety nets, progressive taxation, and better regulation (especially of the financial sector), to name a few – can reverse these devastating trends."
"To generate the political will that such reforms require, we must confront policymakers’ inertia and inaction with the grim facts of inequality and its devastating effects on our children."
"We can reduce childhood deprivation and increase equality of opportunity, thereby laying the groundwork for a more just and prosperous future – one that reflects our own avowed values."
So why don’t we?
"Of the harm that inequality inflicts on our economies, politics, and societies, the damage done to children demands special concern."
"Whatever responsibility poor adults may bear for their lot in life – they may not have worked hard enough, saved enough, or made good decisions – children’s circumstances are thrust upon them without any sort of choice."
"Children, perhaps more than anyone, need the protection that rights afford – and the US should be providing the world with a shining example of what that means."
American Conservatism’s Crisis of Idea
"BERKELEY – On the back left corner of my desk right now are three recent books: Arthur Brooks’ The Battle, Charles Murray’s Coming Apart, and Nicholas Eberstadt’s A Nation of Takers."
"Together, they constitute an important intellectual movement, which also happens to be a large part of the reason that American conservatism today has little that is constructive to say about managing the economy – and little purchase on the center of the American electorate."
"But let’s back up historically, to the founding of what we might call modern conservatism in early nineteenth-century Britain and France."
There were some – Frédéric Bastiat and Jean-Baptiste Say come to mind – who believed that government should put the unemployed to work building infrastructure when markets or production were temporarily disrupted.
"But they were balanced by those like Nassau Senior, who spoke out against even famine relief: Although a million people would die in the Irish Potato Famine, “that would scarcely be enough.”"
"The main thrust of early conservatism was root-and-branch opposition to every form of social insurance: make the poor richer, and they would become more fertile."
"As a result, farm sizes would drop (as land was divided among ever more children), labor productivity would fall, and the poor would become even poorer."
Social insurance was not just pointless; it was counterproductive.
"The proper economic policy was to teach people to venerate the throne (so that they would respect property), the paternal hearth (so that they would not marry imprudently young), and the religious altar (so that they would fear pre-marital sex)."
"Then, perhaps, with women chaste for half or more of their childbearing years, the surplus population would diminish and conditions for the poor would be as good as they could be."
"Fast-forward 150 years to post-World War II America, and to the original Chicago School critique of the New Deal version of social insurance – that it created “notches” that perverted economic incentives."
"The government, Milton Friedman and others argued, told the poor: make more money and we will take away your free housing, food stamps, and income support."
"People are rational, Friedman said, so they will not work for long if they get nothing or next to nothing for it."
"The big difference between the Malthusian conservative critics of social insurance in the early nineteenth century and the Chicago critics of the 1970’s is that the Chicago critics had a point: Providing public support to the “worthy” poor, and then removing it when they began to stand on their own feet, poisoned incentives and was unlikely to lead to good outcomes."
"And so, from 1970 to 2000, a broad coalition of conservatives (who wanted to see the government stop encouraging immorality), centrists (who wanted government money spent effectively), and leftists (who wanted poverty alleviated) removed the “notches” from the social-insurance system."
"Presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and even George W. Bush and their supporters created the current system, in which tax rates and eligibility thresholds are not punitive disincentives to enterprise."
So what is the problem that America’s new generation of conservative critics of social insurance sees?
"It is not that raising poor people’s standard of living above bare subsistence produces Malthusian catastrophe, or that taxes and withdrawal of welfare benefits make people work, at the margin, for nothing."
"For Eberstadt, the problem is that dependence on government is emasculating, and that too many people are dependent on government."
"For Brooks, it is that knowing that public programs make one’s life easier causes one to vote for non-Republican candidates."
"For Murray, it is that social insurance means that behaving badly does not lead to catastrophe – and we need bad behavior to lead to catastrophe in order to keep people from behaving badly."
"The crucial point is that America’s conservative elites believe Brooks, Eberstadt, and Murray."
"To this day, Mitt Romney is convinced that he lost the presidency in 2012 because Barack Obama unfairly gave Latino-Americans subsidized health insurance; gave women free reproductive health coverage (excluding abortion); and gave other groups similar “gifts.”"
He could “never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.”
"In fact, it would be a tough sell for any candidate to convince Americans who receive government benefits that they are dependent rather than empowered; that it is bad for people to vote for politicians who make their lives better; and that good public policy seeks to create human catastrophe rather than to avert it."
The problem for American conservatives is not their choice of candidates or the tone of their rhetoric.
It is that their ideas are not politically sustainable.
American Foreign Policy after Iraq
What comes after Iraq?
"If President George W. Bush’s current troop “surge” fails to produce an outcome that can be called “victory,” what lessons will the United States draw for its future foreign policy?"
"Will it turn inward, as it did after its defeat in Vietnam three decades ago?"
Will it turn from promoting democracy to a narrow realist view of its interests?
"Even while discussion in Washington is fixated on Iraq, a number of thoughtful foreign observers are asking these longer-term questions."
Analysts and pundits have often been mistaken about America’s position in the world.
"For example, two decades ago, the conventional wisdom was that the US was in decline."
"A decade later, with the Cold War’s end, the new conventional wisdom was that the world was a unipolar American hegemony."
"Some neo-conservative pundits drew the conclusion that the US was so powerful that it could decide what it thought was right, and others would have to follow."
"Charles Krauthammer celebrated this view as “the new unilateralism,” and it heavily influenced the Bush administration even before the attacks on September 11, 2001."
But the new unilateralism was based on a profound misunderstanding of the nature of power in world politics.
Power is the ability to get the outcomes one wants.
Whether the possession of resources will produce such outcomes depends upon the context.
"For example, a large, modern tank army is a powerful resource if a war is fought in a desert, but not if it is fought in a swamp – as America discovered in Vietnam."
"In the past, it was assumed that military power dominated most issues, but in today’s world, the contexts of power differ greatly."
I have likened the distribution of power in politics today as analogous to a three-dimensional chess game.
"On the top board – military relations among states – the world is, indeed, unipolar, and likely to remain that way for decades."
"But on the middle board of economic relations, the world is already multipolar, and the US cannot obtain the outcomes it wants without the cooperation of Europe, Japan, China, and others."
"And, on the bottom board of transnational issues outside the control of governments – including everything from climate change to pandemics to transnational terrorism – power is chaotically distributed, and it makes no sense at all to claim American hegemony."
Yet it is on this bottom board that we find most of the greatest challenges we face today.
"The only way to grapple with these problems is through cooperation with others, and that requires the “soft” power of attraction as well as the hard power of coercion."
There is no simple military solution that will produce the outcomes we want.
The new unilateralists who dominated Bush’s first administration made the mistake of thinking that the unipolar distribution of power in the military context was sufficient to guide foreign policy.
They were like a young boy with a hammer who thinks that every problem resembles a nail.
The danger of their approach is now obvious.
Whoever plays a three-dimensional game by focusing on only one board is bound to lose in the long run.
"Fortunately, the pendulum has begun to swing back toward cooperation."
"In Bush’s second term, some of the most extreme unilateralists have departed from the government, and the president has approached difficult problems like North Korea or Iran with a more multilateral approach than during his first term."
"Likewise, for all the complaints about the United Nations, the US and others turned to UN peacekeepers to sort out the mess after the Lebanon War last summer."
"The Iraq War, in particular, increased public awareness of the mistakes in Bush’s first term, but other issues are changing as well."
Americans now view cooperative action on global climate change more favorably.
"Similarly, the threat of pandemics means that Americans may come to recognize the importance of a stronger World Health Organization, just as the problem of nuclear proliferation is increasing awareness of the importance of the International Atomic Energy Agency."
The nature of these problems means that the US does not have the luxury of turning inward no matter what the outcome in Iraq.
These are not problems you can leave overseas.
They follow you home.
It also is unlikely that American foreign policy will return to a narrow realism and drop all emphasis on democracy and human rights.
"While the Iraq War discredited the idea of coercive democratization, both Republicans and Democrats have a strong strand of idealism in their foreign policy orientations."
The problem for whoever is elected president in 2008 will be to find appropriate realistic means to advance democratic values and adjust official rhetoric accordingly.
"When rhetoric greatly outstrips reality, others view it as hypocrisy."
"Americans will need to find ways to assert their narrative of democracy, freedom, and rights in a manner that respects diversity and the views of others."
What Iraq has taught is the importance of developing civil society and the rule of law before trying to hold broad-based elections.
"Democracy is more than voting, for it requires large investments in education, institutions, and promotion of non-governmental organizations."
"It must be rooted in the indigenous society and bear its characteristics, not be imposed from abroad."
It is highly unlikely that the US will react after Iraq as it did after Vietnam.
The paradox of American power is that the world’s only military superpower cannot protect its citizens by acting alone.
American Foreign Policy After the Mid-Term Election
NEW YORK – Few Americans cast their ballot in the recent mid-term elections on the basis of foreign policy.
"While it may be difficult for people around the world to comprehend this, given the global reach of the United States, it is an undeniable fact."
"Most Americans are, after all, preoccupied with the US economy’s sluggish growth and persistent high unemployment."
The world’s challenges seem far removed from their day-to-day lives.
"The Cold War ended a generation ago; the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, are nearly a decade in the past."
Most Americans do not feel the sacrifices associated with the large troop presence and ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.
But the fact that foreign policy did not materially affect the November elections does not mean that the results will not affect US foreign policy.
"They will, but in ways that are inconsistent and even surprising."
One relationship sure to be influenced by Republican gains will be that between the US and Russia.
"Quick or easy Senate approval of the New START arms-control treaty is highly unlikely, given stated concerns about verification and the protection of US missile-defense programs; instead, we can expect delays and, possibly, attempts to amend what the two governments already agreed upon."
"Congress may also prove less willing to remove hurdles to Russia’s admission to the World Trade Organization, given what is widely judged to be its leaders’ anti-democratic behavior."
"China, too, will feel the results of the new balance in Congress."
Pressure was already growing to introduce trade sanctions in response to China’s refusal to allow its currency to rise to a natural level against the dollar.
"Such pressure will likely grow, given concerns over Chinese behavior both at home and abroad."
"Moreover, Congress will resist rolling back any of the long-standing economic sanctions against Cuba."
"President Barack Obama has the authority to take some small steps on his own to normalize ties, but substantial change to US policy requires Congress to act – and Congress wants to see fundamental change in Cuba before it does so."
There will be other consequences stemming from the election.
What little chance there was of the US backing any global plan to limit or tax carbon emissions has disappeared.
Improvement in US performance on climate change will have to come from innovation and increased energy efficiency.
"One can anticipate the Republicans, now in control of the House of Representatives, exploiting their ability to convene hearings to question and review foreign policy."
"Depending on how this power is used (or abused), it can be beneficial (exercising needed oversight and increasing the transparency of policy and policy-making) or destructive (if, for example, hearings degenerate into politically motivated attacks on administration officials and policies)."
"In many other areas, continuity can be expected to trump change."
"This comes as little surprise, as America’s Constitution and political system delegate most of the initiative on foreign policy and defense to the president."
"Yes, Congress must declare war, approve spending, agree to most senior appointments, and (in the case of the Senate) ratify treaties, but the president has enormous latitude when it comes to carrying out diplomacy and using military force in situations other than war, which tend to be most situations."
"One area of probable continuity is the Middle East, where Obama will continue to try to broker a deal between Israelis and Palestinians and press Iran not to develop nuclear weapons."
"(Republicans, however will argue for putting less pressure on Israel to compromise and more pressure on Iran.) But he can expect considerable backing from Republicans if he wants to maintain a sizeable US military presence in Afghanistan beyond this July, or a modest military presence in Iraq beyond the end of 2011."
"Questions abound when it comes to foreign economic policy, however."
"Three completed trade agreements (with South Korea, Panama, and Colombia) have been languishing for years, mostly because of deep opposition to free trade from labor unions and the Democratic Party."
Republicans have historically been more supportive of such bilateral free-trade agreements.
But will the new generation of Republicans continue this tradition?
"There is a fair chance that one or more of these bilateral accords will be approved (in part because the Obama administration seems finally to have recognized that trade can generate good jobs), but it is far less certain that the president will gain the authority needed to negotiate a new global trade deal."
An even bigger question mark hovers over what might be the greatest national security concern of all: the federal budget deficit.
"Failure to address the deficit (and the mounting debt) will create pressures to reduce what the US spends on foreign aid, intelligence, and defense – although Republicans are more likely than Democrats to protect such spending (except for foreign aid)."
Mounting debt also leaves the US vulnerable to the decisions of those who lend it money – or to the vagaries of the market.
A dollar crisis could weaken the foundations of American power.
"But averting such a crisis requires that the White House and Congress, Democrats and Republicans, agree on a plan for moving the US budget toward balance."
"Alas, the election makes such agreement more distant than ever."
America’s Global Balancing Act
"With Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea, the disintegration of Iraq’s and Syria’s borders, and increasing Chinese assertiveness in the South and East China Seas, the post-Cold War era appears to have ended in 2014."
Is that true?
"The post-Cold War era was not really an “era,” but rather a gradual transition from a bilateral Cold War to a more complex international order that still involves, in the final analysis, two world powers."
"In brief, the decisive axis of the new order increasingly involves the United States and the People’s Republic of China."
The Sino-American competition involves two significant realities that distinguish it from the Cold War: neither party is excessively ideological in its orientation; and both parties recognize that they really need mutual accommodation.
America’s supposed “pivot to Asia” took a back seat in 2014 to the crises in Ukraine and the Middle East.
To what extent has uncertainty about the US commitment in Asia stoked tension between China and America’s Asian allies?
I disagree with the premises of the question.
I do think America has made it quite clear that it is in the interest both of America and China to avoid situations in which they will be pushed toward a collision.
"The recent indications of some initial dialogue between China and India, and between China and Japan, suggest that China also realizes that escalating old grievances is not in its interest."
"The more serious problem with the “pivot to Asia” was its actual wording, which implied a military posture designed to “contain” or “isolate” China."
"The Chinese have come to realize more clearly that we were not deliberately attempting to isolate them, but that we had a stake in the avoidance of collisions in the Far East that could produce a wider spillover."
"Xi Jinping has used his war on corruption to concentrate more power in his hands than any Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping, 30 years ago."
How do you see Xi’s presidency evolving?
"Power in China is somewhat informally defined, and its limits are set more by political realities than by constitutional arrangements."
That makes it difficult to say whether Xi’s power is greater than any Chinese leader’s since Deng.
He certainly has an authoritative personality and without doubt is more active on the international scene than some of his predecessors.
"He has also been very decisive in attacking the growing corruption that has become a major source of internal malaise, reaching even the highest levels of government."
"In that respect, it may be argued that his power is more wide-ranging than that of his predecessors, but in fairness it must also be noted that the patterns of corruption that his predecessors faced were not as acute and widespread as they have become in recent years."
"At the same time, the increasing emphasis in party journals on the proposition that China’s armed forces must be viewed as servants of the Communist Party, and not simply of the nation, seems to suggest concern that the military may be developing its own view of Chinese domestic affairs, in addition to proclaiming with increasing assertiveness its responsibility for national security."
"The Party elite, quite understandably, does not find this reassuring."
Can Russian President Vladimir Putin’s regime withstand a prolonged period of low energy prices and Western sanctions?
"What risks do you see emerging should Russia’s economy continue to decline, with Putin increasingly unable to reward his political base?"
"There is, of course, a danger that at some point Putin may choose to lash out and create a truly massive international crisis, and perhaps precipitate some new form of direct East-West warfare. But to say that, one must also assume that to some extent he himself is unbalanced and has shifted from a kind of guerilla warfare against the West, always with some possibility of retreat, to all-out combat."
"The outcome of that would be inherently unpredictable, but probably in any case very destructive for Russian wellbeing."
"If Russia’s economy continues to decline, and if the West succeeds in deterring Putin from further use of force, it is still conceivable that some acceptable resolution (a form of which I recommended publicly by talking about the Finland model) may be contrived. But that depends in turn on the West’s firmness in supporting Ukraine’s efforts to stabilize itself."
"Following the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and Iraq, much of the world now perceives the US as being in a period of “retreat,” similar to the post-Vietnam War era."
Is the US embracing a form of neo-isolationism?
Or will America’s apparent inward turn be as brief as it was following Vietnam?
I do not believe that the US is in a “period of retreat.”
The fact of the matter is that the redistribution of global power has produced a situation in which the US is no longer the sole hegemon.
The US has to acknowledge the fact that the world is now much more complex.
The spread of conflict throughout the Middle East is currently precipitated more by the rise of religious sectarianism than by American interventionism.
"In these volatile circumstances, greater attention must be given to the national interests of countries such as Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Israel."
"By the same token, the interests of any one of them must not be allowed to become the total interest of the US."
What may surprise the world most in 2015?
Perhaps the gradual reappearance in Russia of a more politically assertive liberal middle class.
That middle class was beginning to play a more significant role in shaping domestic and international Russian policy under Dmitri Medvedev.
"With Putin’s return to power and his recent adventurism, it has been pushed aside by deliberately awakened and intensely stimulated national chauvinism."
"Waving a chauvinist banner, however, may not be the best solution for dealing with international problems, especially if the West is intelligent and united."
"The Russian middle class, quite naturally, wishes to live in a society like that of Western Europe."
A Russia that gradually begins to gravitate toward the West will also be a Russia that ceases to disrupt the international system.
America’s Enemy Within
"NEW YORK – Barring any unexpected new revelations, there is not much to be learned from the Tsarnaev brothers, better known as “the Boston bombers.”"
"We can dig into their family histories in strife-torn Dagestan, or examine, once again, the lethal appeal of Islamist radicalism."
But I doubt that this would be enlightening.
"The elder brother, Tamerlan, who died in a gun battle with the police, appears to fit perfectly the profile of what the German writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger calls “the radical loser.”"
"And his younger brother, Dzhokhar, recovering from gunshot wounds in a Boston hospital while waiting to be put on trial for his life, seems to have been a pathetic follower who acted less out of deep conviction than out of fraternal love."
"The radical loser is the kind of young man who feels victimized by an unfeeling, uncaring world."
"That sour sense of rejection, felt by many confused youths, turns for some into a fierce desire for vengeance."
"Like Samson in the temple of Gaza, he wishes to destroy himself in a public act of violence, taking as many people as possible with him."
"Anything can trigger this final act: a lover’s rejection, a job application denied."
"In the case of Tamerlan, a talented boxer, he was denied the chance to become a champion because he was not yet a United States citizen."
Radical Islamism offered him a ready-made cause to die for.
"More interesting, and in a way far more disturbing, has been the reaction in the US to the Boston bombings, which killed three people and injured 264."
"Even after Tamerlan had died, and Dzhokhar, already wounded, was the only known fugitive, the Boston authorities decided to close down the entire city."
"Public transport was halted, trains to and from the city were stopped, shops and business closed, and citizens were told to stay home."
"Until the surviving bomber was found, Boston was reduced to a ghost town."
"If two troubled young men with homemade bombs cobbled together from fertilizer and pressure cookers can have this effect on a major American city, one can imagine how tempting their example must now be to other radical losers, not to mention radical groups."
It shows how vulnerable a modern city can be when its leaders lose their nerve.
"The authorities’ overblown reaction – and that of much of the press – was all the odder for having occurred just as the US Senate was voting down a bill that would have made it harder for known killers and mentally disturbed people to buy guns, or for private individuals to acquire weapons normally used only in warfare."
"It seems as though Americans can tolerate a society in which schoolchildren and other innocents are regularly murdered by deranged men with weapons bought on the open market, but erupt in collective hysteria when the killings are committed by people labeled as “terrorists.”"
This may reflect what people are accustomed to.
The Spanish had grown so inured to acts of violence from Basque separatists that the murder of 191 people in Madrid by Islamist extremists in 2004 was met with remarkable sang-froid.
"When 52 people were killed in a suicide bombing on the London Underground the following year, the British, too, reacted with relative calm, having lived through years of Irish terrorist violence in the 1970’s."
"Like the Spanish, they were used to it."
"Americans, despite the attacks of September 11, 2001, are not."
"Worse than that, a number of Republican senators, including such luminaries as John McCain, called for stripping Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is a US citizen, of his legal rights and placing him before a military tribunal as an “enemy combatant,” as though the 19-year-old college student were a soldier in a war against America."
Exaggerated fear of outside enemies has always been part of the American political landscape.
The “nation of immigrants” was traditionally regarded as a refuge from danger.
The evil outside world should not be able to touch the Land of the Free.
"When it does – Pearl Harbor, September 2001 – all hell breaks loose."
Another factor may be the need for a common enemy in a country whose citizens come from so many different cultures and traditions.
"Besieged by Communists or Islamists, people feel a sense of belonging."
"Defense of the nation against dangerous outsiders – and their domestic agents, whether real or imagined – provides a powerful bond."
"Such bonds can be useful, even necessary, in times of war."
But the politics of fear poses a danger to the US itself.
"The aim of political terrorist groups, such as Al Qaeda, is to provoke retaliation and maximize publicity for their cause."
"As common criminals, such groups’ members would not achieve this goal."
"But by claiming to be soldiers at war with the world’s biggest military power, they gain sympathy, as well as recruits, among the radical losers and the disaffected."
Former President George W. Bush once explained terrorism as the expression of hatred for American freedom.
"But when terrorism results in torture of prisoners, ever more police surveillance, and official threats to US citizens’ legal rights – or, for that matter, when a crime committed by two young immigrants causes an entire city to be shut down – Americans’ government is harming their freedom more than any terrorist could ever hope to do."
American Funk
"NEW YORK – The eccentric Bengali intellectual Nirad C. Chaudhuri once explained the end of the British Raj in India as a case of “funk,” or loss of nerve."
The British had stopped believing in their own empire.
"They simply lost the will, in Rudyard Kipling’s famous words, to fight “the savage wars of peace.”"
"In fact, Kipling’s poem, “The White Man’s Burden,” which exhorted the white race to spread its values to the “new-caught sullen peoples, half devil and half child,” was not about the British Empire at all, but about the United States."
"Subtitled “The United States and the Philippine Islands,” it was published in 1899, just as the US was waging a “savage war of peace” of its own."
Chaudhuri had a point.
It is difficult to sustain an empire without the will to use force when necessary.
"Much political rhetoric, and a spate of new books, would have us believe that the US is now in a dangerous state of funk."
"For example, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney likes to castigate President Barack Obama for “apologizing for America’s international power,” for daring to suggest that the US is not “the greatest country on earth,” and for being “pessimistic.”"
"By contrast, Romney promises to “restore” America’s greatness and international power, which he proposes to do by boosting American military force."
"Romney’s Kipling is the neo-conservative intellectual Robert Kagan, whose new book, The World America Made, argues against “the myth of American decline.”"
"Yes, he admits, China is growing in strength, but US dominance is still overwhelming;"
American military might can still “make right” against any challenger.
"The only real danger to US power is “declinism”: the loss of self-belief, the temptation to “escape from the moral and material burdens that have weighed on [Americans] since World War II.”"
"In a word, funk."
"Like Chaudhuri, Kagan is an engaging writer."
His arguments sound reasonable.
And his assessment of US firepower is no doubt correct.
"True, he has little time for domestic problems like antiquated infrastructure, failing public schools, an appalling health care system, and grotesque disparities in income and wealth."
But he is surely right to observe that no other power is threatening to usurp America’s role as the world’s military policeman.
"Less certain, however, is the premise that the world order would collapse without “American leadership.”"
"France’s King Louis XV allegedly declared on his deathbed: “Après moi, le déluge” (After me, the flood)."
This is the conceit of all great powers.
"Even as the British were dismantling their empire after World War II, the French and Dutch still believed that parting with their Asian possessions would result in chaos."
"And it is still common to hear autocratic leaders who inherited parts of the Western empires claim that democracy is all well and good, but the people are not yet ready for it."
Those who monopolize power cannot imagine a world released from their grip as anything but a catastrophe.
"In Europe after World War II, Pax Americana, guaranteed by US military power, was designed “to keep the Russians out and Germany down.”"
"In Asia, it was meant to contain communism, while allowing allies, from Japan to Indonesia, to build up economic strength."
"Spreading democracy was not the main concern; stopping communism – in Asia, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas – was."
"In this respect, it succeeded, though at great human cost."
"But, now that the specter of global communist domination has joined other fears – real and imagined – in the dustbin of history, it is surely time for countries to start handling their own affairs."
"Japan, in alliance with other Asian democracies, should be able to counterbalance China’s growing power."
"Similarly, Europeans are rich enough to manage their own security."
"But neither Japan nor the European Union seems ready to pull its own weight, owing in part to decades of dependency on US security."
"As long as Uncle Sam continues to police the world, his children won’t grow up."
"In any case, as we have seen in Iraq and Afghanistan, “savage wars of peace” are not always the most effective way to conduct foreign policy."
Old-fashioned military dominance is no longer adequate to promote American interests.
"The Chinese are steadily gaining influence in Africa, not with bombers, but with money."
"Meanwhile, propping up secular dictators in the Middle East with US arms has helped to create Islamist extremism, which cannot be defeated by simplysending more drones."
The notion promoted by Romney and his boosters that only US military power can preserve world order is deeply reactionary.
It is a form of Cold War nostalgia – a dream of returning to a time when much of the globe was recovering from a ruinous world war and living in fear of communism.
"Obama’s recognition of America’s limitations is not a sign of cowardly pessimism, but of realistic wisdom."
His relative discretion in the Middle East has allowed people there to act for themselves.
"We do not yet know what the outcome there will be, but “the greatest country on earth” cannot impose a solution."
Nor should it.
American Gulag
"Recently, the United States achieved the dubious honor of boasting the largest prison and jail population on earth."
It reached this zenith by surpassing cash-strapped Russia - long its only rival as a mass imprisonment society - after Russia released thousands of inmates so as to save money.
"A few years earlier, as America rushed to lock up ever more of its population for ever-pettier offenses, the absolute size of its incarcerated population surpassed that of China - despite China's population being more than four times that of America."
"According to research conducted by the British Home Office, America now incarcerates over one fifth of the world's total prisoners."
There is something bitterly ironic in this.
"For America really is a land of liberty, a place where lives, often scarred by injustice elsewhere, can be remade."
"How tragic, therefore, that over the past twenty years, the country's political leaders have so often decided to deal with many of the most noxious side-effects of poverty - from chronic drug use and the establishment of street drug markets, to hustling, to gang membership and the spraying of graffiti on public buildings - through a vast over-reliance on incarceration."
"How doubly tragic that this has occurred in tandem with a political assault on the Great Society anti-poverty programs put in place during the 1960s; that the investments in infrastructure, public education, public healthcare and job training which might curtail crime more effectively are, instead, being replaced by massive public expenditures on building new prisons to incarcerate hundreds of thousands of low-level offenders."
"With such vicious cycles of crime, punishment and dis-investment in poor communities it is no surprise that the prison population has expanded to such an extent."
The numbers buttressing this sprawling prison system are extraordinary.
"Approximately two million Americans are now serving either prison or jail time, over one million of them for non-violent offenses (a preponderance of these either for drug use or low-level drug sales)."
"Per hundred thousand residents, the US has an incarceration rate over five times that of England, six times that of Canada, and seven times that of Germany."
Somewhere in the region of 10% of African American men in their twenties live behind bars.
"In some states, where a single felony conviction is enough to bar the offender from ever being able to vote again, over one quarter of African American males are disenfranchised."
High levels of disenfranchisement in Florida likely played a critical role in the much-disputed electoral victory of President Bush.
"Since 1980, a virtual ``prison industrial complex'' has arisen, with phenomenal rates of new-prison construction abetted by lucrative construction and prison-guard union lobbies."
"Several states, including California, now spend more on prisons than they do on higher education."
"Despite dramatically falling crime rates over the last ten years (which most criminologists attribute more to demography - there have simply been fewer young men of late - than incarceration), prison populations have continued to soar."
"Much of that increase has more to do with public perceptions about supposed crime waves and ham-handed public and political responses to occasional headline-capturing murders, than any actual underlying crime rate."
"As the actual number of truly heinous crimes has in fact fallen, increasingly it is small-time hoodlums, drug users, and mentally ill people who have been drawing long spells behind bars."
America today has five times as many prisoners as it did in 1980.
"One of the most dismaying developments is the spread of so-called ``three-strikes-and-you're out'' laws. California's version, passed by citizen referendum in 1993 and ratcheted into place by state legislators in 1994, provides for the life imprisonment of any criminal with two previous serious convictions who is found guilty of any third felony."
"One such man is fifty-eight year old heroin addict Billy Ochoa, who is serving a staggering 326 years in a supermax (super maximum security) prison for $2,100 of welfare fraud."
"Because he had been convicted of several burglaries over the previous decades, when Ochoa was caught making fraudulent applications for food stamps and emergency housing vouchers in Los Angeles, he was tried under the Three Strikes law and given sentences on thirteen separate counts to be served in one of the toughest, most secure prisons in America. Ochoa's sentence, apart from its extravagant cruelty, may ultimately cost taxpayers as much as a million dollars."
"In many high security American prisons, inmates are routinely kept in virtual isolation, fed in their cells, allowed out for only half an hour of exercise a day, sometimes denied a TV, a radio, or even decorations for their concrete walls - conditions which have been documented to drive many of them into states of serious psychosis."
How can things have come to this America?
Now is the time - with the world watching America fight to defend its values - for the worst excesses of its criminal justice system to be addressed.
It is a tragedy that a great democracy should have so ugly and vast a prison system corroding both its reputation and its polity.
American Hegemony or American Primacy?
"CAMBRIDGE – No country in modern history has possessed as much global military power as the United States. Yet some analysts now argue that the US is following in the footsteps of the United Kingdom, the last global hegemon to decline."
"This historical analogy, though increasingly popular, is misleading."
Britain was never as dominant as the US is today.
"To be sure, it maintained a navy equal in size to the next two fleets combined, and its empire, on which the sun never set, ruled over a quarter of humankind. But there were major differences in the relative power resources of imperial Britain and contemporary America."
"By the outbreak of World War I, Britain ranked only fourth among the great powers in terms of military personnel, fourth in terms of GDP, and third in military spending."
The British Empire was ruled in large part through reliance on local troops.
"Of the 8.6 million British forces in WWI, nearly a third came from the overseas empire. That made it increasingly difficult for the government in London to declare war on behalf of the empire when nationalist sentiments began to intensify."
"By World War II, protecting the empire had become more of a burden than an asset."
The fact that the UK was situated so close to powers like Germany and Russia made matters even more challenging.
"For all the loose talk of an “American empire,” the fact is that the US does not have colonies that it must administer, and thus has more freedom to maneuver than the UK did. And, surrounded by unthreatening countries and two oceans, it finds it far easier to protect itself."
That brings us to another problem with the global hegemon analogy: the confusion over what “hegemony” actually means.
Some observers conflate the concept with imperialism; but the US is clear evidence that a hegemon does not have to have a formal empire.
"Others define hegemony as the ability to set the rules of the international system; but precisely how much influence over this process a hegemon must have, relative to other powers, remains unclear."
"Still others consider hegemony to be synonymous with control of the most power resources. But, by this definition, nineteenth-century Britain – which at the height of its power in 1870 ranked third (behind the US and Russia) in GDP and third (behind Russia and France) in military expenditures – could not be considered hegemonic, despite its naval dominance."
"Similarly, those who speak of American hegemony after 1945 fail to note that the Soviet Union balanced US military power for more than four decades."
"Though the US had disproportionate economic clout, its room for political and military maneuver was constrained by Soviet power."
"Some analysts describe the post-1945 period as a US-led hierarchical order with liberal characteristics, in which the US provided public goods while operating within a loose system of multilateral rules and institutions that gave weaker states a say."
"They point out that it may be rational for many countries to preserve this institutional framework, even if American power resources decline."
"In this sense, the US-led international order could outlive America’s primacy in power resources, though many others argue that the emergence of new powers portends this order’s demise."
"But, when it comes to the era of supposed US hegemony, there has always been a lot of fiction mixed in with the facts."
"It was less a global order than a group of like-minded countries, largely in the Americas and Western Europe, which comprised less than half of the world. And its effects on non-members – including significant powers like China, India, Indonesia, and the Soviet bloc – were not always benign."
"Given this, the US position in the world could more accurately be called a “half-hegemony.”"
"Of course, America did maintain economic dominance after 1945: the devastation of WWII in so many countries meant that the US produced nearly half of global GDP."
"That position lasted until 1970, when the US share of global GDP fell to its pre-war level of one-quarter. But, from a political or military standpoint, the world was bipolar, with the Soviet Union balancing America’s power."
"Indeed, during this period, the US often could not defend its interests: the Soviet Union acquired nuclear weapons; communist takeovers occurred in China, Cuba, and half of Vietnam; the Korean War ended in a stalemate; and revolts in Hungary and Czechoslovakia were repressed."
"Against this background, “primacy” seems like a more accurate description of a country’s disproportionate (and measurable) share of all three kinds of power resources: military, economic, and soft."
The question now is whether the era of US primacy is coming to an end.
"Given the unpredictability of global developments, it is, of course, impossible to answer this question definitively."
"The rise of transnational forces and non-state actors, not to mention emerging powers like China, suggests that there are big changes on the horizon. But there is still reason to believe that, at least in the first half of this century, the US will retain its primacy in power resources and continue to play the central role in the global balance of power."
"In short, while the era of US primacy is not over, it is set to change in important ways."
Whether or not these changes will bolster global security and prosperity remains to be seen.
American Pie in the Sky
"NEW YORK – While the risk of a disorderly crisis in the eurozone is well recognized, a more sanguine view of the United States has prevailed."
"For the last three years, the consensus has been that the US economy was on the verge of a robust and self-sustaining recovery that would restore above-potential growth."
"That turned out to be wrong, as a painful process of balance-sheet deleveraging – reflecting excessive private-sector debt, and then its carryover to the public sector – implies that the recovery will remain, at best, below-trend for many years to come."
"Even this year, the consensus got it wrong, expecting a recovery to above-trend &nbsp;annual GDP growth – faster than 3%."
"But the first-half growth rate looks set to come in closer to 1.5% at best, even below 2011’s dismal 1.7%."
"And now, after getting the first half of 2012 wrong, many are repeating the fairy tale that a combination of lower oil prices, rising auto sales, recovering house prices, and a resurgence of US manufacturing will boost growth in the second half of the year and fuel above-potential growth by 2013."
"The reality is the opposite: for several reasons, growth will slow further in the second half of 2012 and be even lower in 2013 – close to stall speed."
"First, growth in the second quarter has decelerated from a mediocre 1.8% in January-March, as job creation – averaging 70,000 a month – fell sharply."
"Second, expectations of the “fiscal cliff” – automatic tax increases and spending cuts set for the end of this year – will keep spending and growth lower through the second half of 2012."
So will uncertainty about who will be President in 2013; about tax rates and spending levels; about the threat of another government shutdown over the debt ceiling; and about the risk of another sovereign rating downgrade should political gridlock continue to block a plan for medium-term fiscal consolidation.
"In such conditions, most firms and consumers will be cautious about spending – an option value of waiting – thus further weakening the economy."
"Third, the fiscal cliff would amount to a 4.5%-of-GDP drag on growth in 2013 if all tax cuts and transfer payments were allowed to expire and draconian spending cuts were triggered."
"Of course, the drag will be much smaller, as tax increases and spending cuts will be much milder."
"But, even if the fiscal cliff turns out to be a mild growth bump – a mere 0.5% of GDP – and annual growth at the end of the year is just 1.5%, as seems likely, the fiscal drag will suffice to slow the economy to stall speed: a growth rate of barely 1%."
"Fourth, private consumption growth in the last few quarters does not reflect growth in real wages (which are actually falling)."
"Rather, growth in disposable income (and thus in consumption) has been sustained since last year by another $1.4 trillion in tax cuts and extended transfer payments, implying another $1.4 trillion of public debt."
"Unlike the eurozone and the United Kingdom, where a double-dip recession is already under way, owing to front-loaded fiscal austerity, the US has prevented some household deleveraging through even more public-sector releveraging –&nbsp;that is, by stealing some growth from the future."
"In 2013, as transfer payments are phased out, however gradually, and as some tax cuts are allowed to expire, disposable income growth and consumption growth will slow."
"The US will then face not only the direct effects of a fiscal drag, but also its indirect effect on private spending."
"Fifth, four external forces will further impede US growth: a worsening eurozone crisis; an increasingly hard landing for China; a generalized slowdown of emerging-market economies, owing to cyclical factors (weak advanced-country growth) and structural causes (a state-capitalist model that reduces potential growth); and the risk of higher oil prices in 2013 as negotiations and sanctions fail to convince Iran to abandon its nuclear program."
"Policy responses will have very limited effect in stemming the US economy’s deceleration toward stall speed: even with only a mild fiscal drag on growth, the US dollar is likely to strengthen as the eurozone crisis weakens the euro and as global risk aversion returns."
"The US Federal Reserve will carry out more quantitative easing this year, but it will be ineffective: long-term interest rates are already very low, and lowering them further would not boost spending."
"Indeed, the credit channel is frozen and velocity has collapsed, with banks hoarding increases in base money in the form of excess reserves."
"Moreover, the dollar is unlikely to weaken as other countries also carry out quantitative easing."
"Similarly, the gravity of weaker growth will most likely overcome the levitational effect on equity prices from more quantitative easing, particularly given that equity valuations today are not as depressed as they were in 2009 or 2010."
"Indeed, growth in earnings and profits is now running out of steam, as the effect of weak demand on top-line revenues takes a toll on bottom-line margins and profitability."
"A significant equity-price correction could, in fact, be the force that in 2013 tips the US economy into outright contraction."
"And if the US (still the world’s largest economy) starts to sneeze again, the rest of the world – its immunity already weakened by Europe’s malaise and emerging countries’ slowdown – will catch pneumonia."
American Power after Bin Laden
"OXFORD – When one state is preponderant in power resources, observers often refer to the situation as hegemonic."
"Today, many pundits argue that other countries’ rising power and the loss of American influence in a revolutionary Middle East point to the decline of “American hegemony.” But the term is confusing."
"For one thing, possession of power resources does not always imply that one can get the outcomes one prefers."
Even the recent death of Osama bin Laden at the hands of United States special forces does not indicate anything about American power one way or the other.
"To see why, consider the situation after World War II. The US accounted for more than one-third of global product and had an overwhelming preponderance in nuclear weapons."
Many considered it a global hegemon.
"Nonetheless, the US was unable to prevent the “loss” of China, “roll back” communism in Eastern Europe, prevent stalemate in the Korean War, defeat Vietnam’s National Liberation Front, or dislodge the Castro regime in Cuba."
"Even in the era of alleged American hegemony, studies show that only one-fifth of America’s efforts to compel change in other countries through military threats were successful, while economic sanctions worked in only half of all cases."
"Yet many believe that America’s current preponderance in power resources is hegemonic, and that it will decline, like that of Britain before it."
"Some Americans react emotionally to that prospect, though it would be ahistorical to believe that the US will have a preponderant share of power resources forever."
"But the term “decline” conflates two different dimensions of power: absolute decline, in the sense of decay or loss of ability to use one’s resources effectively, and relative decline, in which the other states’ power resources become greater or are used more effectively."
"For example, in the seventeenth century, the Netherlands flourished domestically but declined in relative power as other states grew in strength."
"Conversely, the Western Roman Empire did not succumb to another state, but instead to internal decay and swarms of barbarians."
Rome was an agrarian society with low economic productivity and a high level of internecine strife.
"While the US has problems, it hardly fits the description of absolute decline in ancient Rome, and the analogy to British decline, however popular, is similarly misleading."
"Britain had an empire on which the sun never set, ruled more than a quarter of humankind, and enjoyed naval supremacy. But there are major differences in the relative power resources of imperial Britain and contemporary America."
"By World War I, Britain ranked only fourth among the great powers in terms of military personnel, fourth in GDP, and third in military spending."
"The costs of defense averaged 2.5-3.4% of GDP, and the empire was ruled in large part with local troops."
"In 1914, Britain’s net export of capital gave it an important financial kitty to draw upon (though some historians consider that it would have been better to have invested the money in domestic industry)."
"Of the 8.6 million British forces in WWI, nearly one-third were provided by the overseas empire."
"With the rise of nationalism, however, it became increasingly difficult for London to declare war on behalf of the empire, the defense of which became a heavier burden."
"By contrast, America has had a continental-scale economy immune from nationalist disintegration since 1865."
"For all the loose talk of American empire, the US is less tethered and has more degrees of freedom than Britain ever had."
"Indeed, America’s geopolitical position differs profoundly from that of imperial Britain: while Britain faced rising neighbors in Germany and Russia, America benefits from two oceans and weaker neighbors."
"Despite these differences, Americans are prone to cycles of belief in decline."
The Founding Fathers worried about comparisons to the decline of the Roman republic.
"Moreover, cultural pessimism is very American, extending back to the country’s Puritan roots."
"As Charles Dickens observed a century and a half ago, “if its individual citizens, to a man, are to be believed, [America] always is depressed, and always is stagnated, and always is in an alarming crisis, and never was otherwise.”"
"More recently, polls showed widespread belief in decline after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik in 1957, then again during the Nixon-era economic shocks in the 1970’s, and after Ronald Reagan’s budget deficits in the 1980’s."
"At the end of that decade, American’s believed the country was in decline; yet, within a decade, they believed that the US was the sole superpower."
Now many have gone back to believing in decline.
Cycles of declinism tell us more about American psychology than about underlying shifts in power resources.
"Some observers, such as the Harvard historian Niall Ferguson, believe that “debating the stages of decline may be a waste of time – it is a precipitous and unexpected fall that should most concern policy makers and citizens.”"
"Ferguson believes that a doubling of public debt in the coming decade cannot erode US strength on its own, but that it could weaken a long-assumed faith in America’s ability to weather any crisis."
"Ferguson is correct that the US will have to come to terms with its budget deficit to maintain international confidence, but, as I show in my book The Future of Power, doing so is within the range of possible outcomes."
"America enjoyed a budget surplus only a decade ago, before George W. Bush’s tax cuts, two wars, and recession created fiscal instability."
"The US economy is still ranked near the top in competitiveness by the World Economic Forum, and the political system, in its own messy way, has slowly begun to wrestle with the necessary changes."
Some believe a political compromise between Republicans and Democrats can be reached before the 2012 election; others suggest an agreement is more likely after the election.
"Either way, fuzzy statements about hegemonic decline would again prove misleading."
American Retreat
"Los Angeles – As Barack Obama’s incoming administration debates the pace and consequences of withdrawal from Iraq, it would do well to examine the strategic impact of other American exits in the final decades of the twentieth century."
"Although American commitments to Lebanon, Somalia, Vietnam, and Cambodia differed mightily, history reveals that despite immediate costs to America’s reputation, disengagement ultimately redounded to America’s advantage."
"In all of these cases, regional stability of sorts emerged after an American military withdrawal, albeit at the cost of a significant loss of life."
"America’s former adversaries either became preoccupied with consolidating or sharing power, suffered domestic defeat, or confronted neighboring states."
"Ultimately, America’s vital interests prevailed."
The evidence today suggests that this pattern can be repeated when the United States departs Mesopotamia and leaves Iraqis to define their own fate.
"Of the four withdrawals, arguably the 1982-1984 American intervention in Lebanon marks the closest parallel to Iraq today."
"A country torn by sectarian violence beginning in 1975, Lebanon pitted an even more complex array of contestants against each other than Iraq does today."
Into this fray stepped the US and its Western allies.
Their objective was to create a military buffer between the PLO and Israeli forces that were then fighting in Beirut in order to promote the departure of both.
"The massacres in Palestinian refugee camps prompted a new commitment to “restore a strong and central government” to Lebanon, to quote President Ronald Reagan. But the result of intervention was that US forces became just one more target, culminating in the 1983 bombing of a US Marine barracks that killed 241 American soldiers."
A similar suicide bombing two days later claimed the lives of 58 French soldiers.
"In February 1984, facing a quagmire, Reagan acceded to Vice President George H.W. Bush’s recommendation to get out of Lebanon. But the withdrawal of Western forces did not stop the fighting."
"The civil war continued for another six years, followed by a bumpy political aftermath: Syrian intervention and expulsion (two decades later), as the Lebanese defined their own fate with the US exercising only background influence."
"In 1992, the sirens of Somalia’s political collapse lured the US into another civil war to save a country from itself."
The US humanitarian mission to that benighted country sought to salvage a failed United Nations enterprise to secure and feed Somalia’s ravaged population.
"The US committed 28,000 troops, which for a time imposed a modicum of security. But ill-equipped and poorly led UN replacement forces for the American presence put the remaining US troops in the bull’s eye as they attempted to bring to justice the Somali warlord responsible for the death of Pakistani peacekeepers."
"The ensuing bloodbath of US soldiers generated images that the American public could not stomach, prompting the exit of American and then UN forces."
"As unrest mounted with these military retreats, offshore US forces monitored and intercepted jihadists who sought to enter Somalia, while Kenya and Ethiopia blocked the unrest from metastasizing across the region."
"In 2006, the capture of Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu, by the Islamic Courts raised the specter of a jihadist state. But Somalia soon demonstrated that quagmires can be a two-way street."
"Following Ethiopia’s intervention, the Islamists found themselves out of power."
"Today, Somalia remains a dysfunctional state, as rival clans, jihadists, and an interim government with Ethiopian support compete for power."
"The US, now out of the quagmire, exercises limited influence from afar."
"While Lebanon and Somalia remain damaged and failed states, respectively, regional and domestic factors have cauterized the consequences of America’s retreat from Vietnam and Southeast Asia."
"The result is the stable region that the world sees today. But the US saw things very differently in the 1960’s, when the ghosts of Munich hovered over Vietnam’s jungles."
"As President George W. Bush argued about the war in Iraq, US President Lyndon Johnson predicted that defeat in Vietnam “would be renewed in one country and then another.”"
What Johnson failed to foresee were the domestic and regional constraints that would prevent the dominos from falling in the way he predicted.
"Although the US bombed northeastern Cambodia intensely throughout the Vietnam War years, it had no stomach for a ground commitment there."
"Still within congressional restraints, the Nixon administration attempted to bolster Cambodia’s military government. But, despite modest material support, the US could not sustain a government that could not sustain itself."
"Rather than the dominos falling following America’s retreat from Saigon in 1975, a Vietnam-Cambodian War ensued. This in turn stimulated China’s unsuccessful intervention in North Vietnam."
"The withdrawal by all of these invading armies to the recognized international boundaries demonstrated that nationalist forces were dominant in the region, not communist solidarity."
"None of these American exits was without consequence. But, while the US suffered costs to its reputation around the world, the supposed advantages from this for America’s opponents proved illusory."
"America’s departure from Mesopotamia will likewise put the burden of problem solving onto Iraqis and other regional players, leaving the US offshore to assist when and where it deems appropriate."
"History suggests that, in fits and starts, Iraq, like Vietnam and Lebanon, will find itself able to sort out its own affairs."
"Americans are from Italy, Europeans are from Japan"
MUNICH – The American business model has collapsed.
"During recent years, the United States borrowed gigantic sums of money from the rest of the word."
Net capital imports exceeded $800 billion in 2008 alone.
"The money came largely from selling mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, claims against claims against American homeowners (or to be precise, only against the homes themselves, as the owners were protected by the non-recourse nature of loans)."
The market for such securities has now vanished.
"While the volume of new issues in 2006 was $1.9 trillion, the likely volume in 2009 will be just $50 billion, according to the most recent IMF estimates."
The market declined by 97%.
No number reveals the true catastrophe of the American financial system more than this one.
"As the flow of funds from the world to US homeowners was disrupted, house prices collapsed by 30%, and construction of new homes by more than 70%."
The recession was inevitable.
"Laid-off construction workers tightened their belts, as did homeowners."
Some did so because they felt poorer.
"Others did so because the banks, shocked by the collapse of the securitization business, stopped giving them home-equity loans for consumption purposes."
"In the last years before the crisis, the flow of new mortgages had been 60% higher than the value of residential construction."
Now it is 150% lower.
The first eleven months of the recession that followed were as severe as the first eleven months of the Great Depression that started in 1929.
"But gigantic Keynesian recovery packages worth more than $1.4 trillion worldwide, together with bank rescue packages worth about $8 trillion, have had their effect."
"They stopped the decline in the spring and early summer of this year, bringing the recession to what one hopes is more than a temporary halt."
"Underutilization of capacity, however, remains huge."
"It will take years for the world economy to return to trend, in particular as the growth outlook is not very promising and unemployment continues to rise in the US and Europe."
"The medicine that has helped, and that remains necessary for the time being, is government debt."
"Governments absorb the excess of private savings over private investment and re-inject it into the global economy, thereby stabilizing aggregate demand and the financial system."
"As a result, public deficits are shooting up everywhere."
"Nearly all European Union countries will violate the Stability and Growth Pact’s 3%-of-GDP cap on fiscal deficits in 2009, and some of them will have deficits at or above 10% of GDP, notably Spain (10%), the United Kingdom (14%), and Ireland (16%)."
"The US, the epicenter of the crisis, is in particular trouble."
"By the end of this year, America’s debt-to-GDP ratio will have climbed to 87% from 73% in 2008, and, with next year’s deficit set to reach 11% of GDP, it is certain that the ratio will surpass 100% during 2011."
The country that used to be the symbol of capitalist stability and strength now shows frightening similarities to the developing countries that suffered from the world debt crisis in the early 1980’s.
"Although countries can become insolvent, they have many ways to reduce their sovereign debt before this happens."
"The US is considering the possibility of imposing a bequest tax on foreign holdings of US securities, and many people believe that it will try to play “the Italian card”: inflating away its public debt and devaluing the currency in order to maintain international competitiveness."
"To be sure, inflation is difficult to bring about when short-term interest rates are near zero – and thus cannot be reduced any further without inducing massive hoarding of cash."
"Nevertheless, investors around the world currently fear such a scenario, and this may create a self-fulfilling prophesy, because it helps to drive down the dollar, boost export demand, and make US imports more expensive."
"Ironically, flexible exchange rates help the very country that caused the crisis."
There is no justice in economic mechanisms.
The opposite is true in Europe.
"There the European Central Bank has also used up its gunpowder and cannot create inflation even if it wished to do so (which it cannot, because the Maastricht Treaty defines preservation of price stability as the ECB’s only goal.)"
"But the strengthening euro reduces both import prices and export demand, which, in itself, causes prices to fall ."
"In all likelihood, therefore, Europe will not be playing the Italian card; instead, it will face substantial difficulties in freeing itself from its current stagnation."
"The risk for Europe is that it goes down the Japanese, rather than the Italian, path."
"After its banking crisis of 1987-1989, Japan experienced two decades of stagnation and deflation with skyrocketing government debt."
Preventing a repetition of this scenario is the main challenge for European policymakers in the coming years.
America’s Anti-Environmentalist
"As an American, I am appalled, ashamed, and embarrassed by my country’s lack of leadership in dealing with global warming."
"Scientific evidence on the risks mounts by the day, as most recently documented in England’s magisterial Stern Report ."
"Yet, despite the fact that the United States accounts for roughly 25% of all man-made global carbon emissions, Americans show little will or inclination to temper their manic consumption."
"The first George W. Bush administration was probably right to refuse to sign the so-called “Kyoto Protocol,” albeit for the wrong reasons."
"Among other problems, the Kyoto Protocol does not go far enough towards redistributing carbon emission rights towards developing countries."
But why can’t the US bring itself to raise taxes on gasoline and other sources of carbon emission like coal burning power plants?
"It is not like the US government, running a huge deficit despite an economic boom, does not need the money."
Many people seem to think that the Bush administration is the problem.
"Put a Texas oilman and his buddies in charge and what do you expect, conservation?"
"Unfortunately, that is a facile excuse."
American citizens’ resistance to moderating energy consumption for the sake of the global environment is much more deeply embedded.
"Consider former US Vice President Al Gore, for example, whose documentary film on global warming, An Inconvenient Truth , is celebrated for its unflinching look at how fossil fuel consumption is leading mankind to the brink of catastrophe."
"The evidence on global warming is considerably more muddled than Gore’s film suggests, but the basic problem is real."
"Unfortunately, however, Gore was not successful in carrying the torch on global warming when he was a politician."
One cannot commend the 1990’s Clinton-Gore administration for taking any brave steps aimed at radically reducing carbon emissions.
"Small wonder: the American public is fiercely resistant to anything that seriously forces them to compromise on their energy-burning, gas-guzzling lifestyle."
It is not just politicians who have failed to provide leadership here.
The venerable
"The typical argument one hears is, “What about the poor guy with the gas-guzzling 1980 Chevy car, who has no other way to get to work?”"
"It is a legitimate point, but if ocean levels start rising, as the"
The change of position by the
"Until Americans suck it up and start fixing global environmental problems that they, more than anyone, have caused, it will be difficult to get the wholehearted support of the rest of the world."
Developing countries ask why they should pay attention to global warming if rich countries are not prepared to curtail their own emissions sharply?
Why should poor countries worry about how deforestation contributes to global warming when rich countries remain so profligate?
The scientific evidence suggests that carbon emissions from anywhere in the world have about the same impact on global warming.
"For this reason, a wide range of economists favor a uniform (“harmonized”) global tax that would tax carbon emissions equally everywhere in the world, and from whatever source – whether coal, oil, or gas, and whether consumers or businesses."
"Such a tax is the most flexible and market-friendly approach, and would have the least impact on economic growth."
"Instead, the complex system of quotas favored by the Europeans and embodied in the Kyoto Protocol is likely to lead to much larger inefficiencies and costs."
"For this reason, England’"
America’s unwillingness to take the lead on environmental issues may some day be regarded as one of the country’s most profound political failures.
"One hopes that it changes course soon, before we all are forced to wear swimsuits to work."
America’s Anti-Immigrant Road Rage
"Because Latin American countries enjoy the billions of dollars that their countrymen in the United States send home, they should take note of how many of their benefactors are being treated by American officials."
"Despite their numbers – the Urban Institute estimates that more than nine million undocumented immigrants live in the US, a number that exceeds the entire populations of countries like Costa Rica and Nicaragua – the undocumented worker has long been North America’s favorite punching bag."
"Damned on Sunday, they are hired for work on Monday."
"Attacks on immigrants went into high gear in February, when the US Congress passed a bill that will make it illegal for any state to issue driver’s licenses to undocumented workers."
"No one in America is even writing about this or taking much notice because few care about those who are in the US illegally. Undocumented workers pick America’s crops, clean Americans’ houses, and serve Americans their food, but their fate simply does not matter to many US citizens."
Most groups with nine million members who represent billions of dollars would be raising hell in Congress if they were targeted for ill treatment.
"But the money undocumented workers earn goes abroad to build homes, start businesses, and take care of elderly parents throughout Latin America. So the countries that benefit from this largesse have a responsibility to speak up for the constituents who help keep their economies afloat."
"US Congresswoman Linda Sanchez says that if foreign presidents don’t speak up for their constituents in America, few others will."
"If California is any indicator, a ban on driver’s licenses won’t be effective in keeping undocumented workers off the road."
"It will merely make life riskier and more expensive for them, pushing them even further to the margins of society."
"Gil Cedillo, a California state senator who has been trying to reverse earlier legislation that in 1994 made it illegal for undocumented workers in California to drive, wrote in a recent policy paper, “While the number of immigrant drivers may be minimally reduced, most simply drive without being trained, tested, licensed, and insured.”"
"Unlicensed drivers, he found, are nearly five times more likely to be in a fatal crash. In addition to all the deaths, the net result of this, Cedillo found, was that unlicensed drivers cost Californians some $831 million a year in uninsured motorist coverage."
"In some neighborhoods of Los Angeles where undocumented immigrants are concentrated, roughly 90% of drivers are uninsured."
"Immigrants need to get to work and so they buy, sell, drive, and abandon cars in a parallel market."
"When I talked to immigrants in Oakland, they called their license “tu licencia con dios,” or “your license with God.”"
A benevolent God keeps the immigrant from being stopped by the police.
Undocumented workers thus enter the cycle of those who live and drive with nearly throwaway cars that cost between $200 and $700.
"When it breaks down, the car of an unlicensed driver is towed to a lot, where it is rarely claimed."
It is then put up for auction and repurchased by agents who in turn sell it to another unlicensed immigrant.
"The trick for an immigrant is to always buy cheap, because he never knows how long it will be before a car breaks down."
It is time for Latin America’s leaders to stand up for citizens who mean so much for their countries’ economies.
"For example, fighting the Congress’s proposed nationwide ban on driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants could be a high priority while negotiating new trade agreements with the US. In any case, the time to act is now: once the ban is passed by Congress and signed by the president, it is unlikely to be lifted any time soon."
The California experience is a case in point.
"Probably no other state governor has the political clout to win against the tide of activists who regard offering an undocumented immigrant a driver’s license as tantamount to offering them work, which they already have, and legitimacy, which they apparently don’t need to work."
While repealing one law to satisfy his voters – and get elected – Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger promised new legislation that would restore undocumented workers’ ability to obtain a driver’s license.
"But the anti-immigrant vitriol of the 1990’s, which pushed California’s legislature to impose the ban, remains strong, and not even the immigrant Terminator can muster the courage to fight it."
"Instead, Schwarzenegger, like other Americans, makes laws in the belief that nine million undocumented workers do not matter."
America’s Arab Comeback
"AMMAN – Without much fanfare, the past few months have seen no anti-American demonstrations and no burning of American flags across the Arab world."
Arabs seem increasingly willing to accept – and even applaud – the Obama administration’s policy toward the region.
"Of course, Arabs are still unhappy with the United States’ continued bias towards Israel. Its inability to end the 44-year military occupation of Palestinian lands has not gone unnoticed."
"But many Arabs nowadays prefer to give the US a break. With the exception of the Obama administration’s lack of resolve in denouncing the treatment of protesters by the US-allied regimes in Bahrain and Yemen, America’s position on the Arab revolts has been welcomed."
"Arabs, especially young Arabs, who comprise the majority of the region’s population, look up to America for its global power when it upholds democratic morals and values."
"There is high respect for the concept of rule of, by, and for the people, as well as for the US Constitution’s guarantee of freedom of expression."
It is precisely the failure to apply these values in areas such as Palestine or Iraq that has made – and can still make – countless Arabs vehemently anti-American.
"President Barack Obama’s election two years ago positively shocked Arabs and empowered Arab democrats, who saw it as proof of America’s true democratic nature."
"Obama’s Cairo speech, delivered on one of his first foreign trips, promised a new US-Arab beginning, and certainly invigorated Arab democrats."
But the first test of Obama’s foreign leadership disappointed many Arabs.
A US veto of a Security Council resolution – supported by the Council’s 14 other members – to oppose Israeli settlements seemed to signal that Obama had crumbled under pressure from America’s pro-Israel lobby.
"The US had not revised its policy, even with an African immigrant’s son living in the White House."
A more positive view of Obama emerged when the Arab revolts began in Tunisia and Egypt –countries with pro-US regimes.
"While the US initially demonstrated prudence in word and deed, it quickly understood that the revolts truly reflected the will of the people and acted to align itself with the democratic cause."
The same people that Obama had called on in his Cairo speech to seek democracy had now formed the most important nonviolent movement the world had seen in decades.
"Arab youth had finally moved, and Obama and his team made the right statements to encourage them, while also making it clear to the Egyptian and Tunisian regimes that they could no longer hide behind the claim that they were fighting America’s war in north Africa."
Pulling away from dictators without trying to take credit for or hijack the revolt was exactly what was required.
Arab youth had to fight and win democracy for themselves.
"All that what was wanted from America, most of the young people thought, was withdrawal of its support for allies like Hosni Mubarak and other Arab dictators."
"In Libya, however, the need was different."
"The same energy on display in Cairo and Tunis was evident among Libyan youth, but this time, America was able to do little diplomatically because it had no relationship with Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi."
"So, no surprise, the energy of Libyan youth ran head-on into Qaddafi’s inclination toward brutality and, more importantly, into his paid mercenaries."
America had a moral responsibility to protect the young people whom Obama had encouraged.
"Another type of help was needed, but deciding what form it should take was complicated."
"Arab countries, especially Egypt, had hundreds of thousands of their nationals working in Libya."
"Their governments saw themselves as Qaddafi’s hostages. But what the Arab countries couldn’t do with military support, they were able to do by providing political cover for the military intervention led by the US, Britain, and France."
"The Gulf countries, which have no citizens working in Libya, were the first to denounce Qaddafi."
Then the Arab League met to follow the Gulf states’ lead.
"With angry young Arabs from different countries demonstrating outside its Cairo offices and demanding support for their Libyan brethren, the Arab League took an uncharacteristic position: it agreed to denounce a fellow Arab leader."
"Clearly, the Arab world was changing, and the US was suddenly no longer an enemy, but a friend."
"After gaining Security Council support, the US, Europe, and some Arab countries began doing exactly what should be expected of the international community when a government is preparing to butcher its own citizens: prevent the slaughter."
"Of course, America’s problems with Arabs and its challenges in the Middle East are far from over."
Obama must still fulfill his promises to celebrate with Palestinians their full membership of the UN this fall and to draw down its forces in Afghanistan.
"But, for the moment, Arabs are not demonstrating against America. Instead, with America’s help, they are enjoying the first blush of freedom."
A New Low for China Bashing
"NEW HAVEN – As America’s election season nears its finish, the debate seems to have come unhinged."
"Nowhere is that more evident than in the fixation on China – singled out by both President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, as a major source of pressure bearing down on American workers and their families."
"Get tough with China, both stressed in the presidential debates, and the pain will ease."
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Consider the following charges:
Currency manipulation.
"Since China reformed its exchange-rate regime in July 2005, the renminbi has risen 32% relative to the dollar and about 30% in inflation-adjusted terms against a broad basket of currencies."
"These are hardly trivial amounts, and more renminbi appreciation can be expected in the years to come."
"Unlike Japan, which was pressured by the West into a large yen revaluation in 1985 (the “Plaza Accord”), the Chinese have opted to move gradually and deliberately."
"American officials call this “manipulation,” arguing that market forces would have resulted in a sharper renminbi appreciation than has occurred."
"Fixated on stability – a concept alien to US politicians and policymakers – the Chinese prefer, instead, to play a more active role in managing the adjustment of their currency."
I call that prudence – perhaps even wisdom.
"Two lost decades later, the guinea pig, Japan, might have a view on which approach works best."
Outsourcing and intellectual property.
"Notwithstanding some recent modest improvements in the US labor market, America’s job situation remains terrible."
Private-sector employment is still down 4.1 million from its January 2008 peak.
Yet there is not a shred of evidence to support bipartisan claims that this ongoing carnage is the result of outsourcing US manufacturing jobs to China.
"While the manufacturing sector’s share of private employment fell from 11.9% in January 2008 to 10.7% in September 2012, this is only a small portion of the enormous secular decline since the early 1970’s, when manufacturing accounted for more than 30% of private-sector employment."
Weak demand – especially the post-crisis collapse in consumer spending growth – is a far more likely culprit than China in explaining the recent hiring shortfall.
"China, for its part, has become a major workhorse of globalization – an assembly hub for inputs produced by multi-country supply chains and an offshore efficiency solution for hard-pressed Western multinational corporations."
"About 50% of all exports leaving China have been processed previously by other economies, and close to 60% are shipped by Chinese subsidiaries of “foreign-invested enterprises.”"
"While these trends benefit Chinese workers, they also support America and other countries by holding down inflation and making it possible for their companies to cope with tough competitive pressures."
They allow beleaguered American families to stretch their paychecks (think Wal-Mart).
And they have not stopped innovative Western companies from putting their intellectual property and new technologies on the line in China in order to deliver spectacular new products to US customers (think Apple).
The trade deficit.
"Yes, the US runs a massive trade deficit with China – around $295 billion in 2011, or fully 40% of America’s total merchandise trade gap of $738 billion."
"Republicans and Democrats alike argue that this is the crux of America’s jobs problem. After all, trade deficits mean job losses."
"Because the biggest share of the US trade gap is with China, a country vilified as a currency-manipulating cheater, the bilateral trade deficit has become the lightening rod for China bashers."
"It is what has driven Obama to go to the mat with China on recent disputes within the World Trade Organization and on restrictions on Chinese investment in Oregon wind farms, and what has led to saber-rattling by Romney on currency manipulation and trade sanctions."
But neither candidate acknowledges the much bigger elephant in the room.
"In 2011, the US had trade deficits with 98 countries."
"The other 97 deficits did not magically appear. They are all part of an enormous multilateral trade deficit that stems from America’s unprecedented shortfall of saving – a depreciation-adjusted “net national saving rate” (combining businesses, households, and the government sector) that has been negative since 2008."
"Lacking in savings and wanting to grow, the US runs massive current-account and multilateral trade deficits in order to import other countries’ surplus savings."
This goes to the heart of the folly of China bashing.
No leading country in world history has persistently maintained a negative saving rate.
Trade deficits – with China or any other country – are part of the price that America pays for its unbridled profligacy.
"Unless and until the US faces up to its chronic aversion to saving – namely, by reducing massive federal budget deficits and encouraging the rebuilding of severely depleted household saving – multilateral trade deficits will persist."
Simple arithmetic and basic economics tell us that a multilateral problem cannot be addressed by a bilateral solution.
Politicians have a penchant for simple and powerful messages. Yet those messages are often more spin than substance.
"American families are hurting, and elected officials want to pin the blame on China, thereby deflecting attention from the difficult task of rebuilding saving, restoring competitiveness, and living within the country’s means."
"Indeed, one could argue that it is the American public that is being manipulated by the erroneous charges leveled at China."
"Fortunately, the campaign season is nearly over."
"Left unanswered, however, is what comes next."
China bashers typically change their tune after a presidential election.
But there is nothing typical about the pressures that are likely to continue squeezing American families long after November 6.
Both Obama and Romney run the risk of painting themselves into a corner when it comes to China.
That could take all of us to the edge of a slippery slope.
America’s Coming Social Democracy?
"Almost all of the world’s developed countries consider themselves, and are, social democracies: mixed economies with very large governments performing a wide array of welfare and social insurance functions, and removing large chunks of wealth and commodity distribution from the market."
The United States is something different. Or is it?
"Whatever it has been in the past, the US in the future will have to choose whether, and how much, it will be a social democracy."
"Once upon a time, according to mythology at least, America had little downward mobility."
"On the contrary, before the Civil War you could start out splitting rails, light out for the Western Territory, make a success of yourself on the frontier, and wind up as President – if you were named Abraham Lincoln."
"In the generation after World War II, you could secure a blue-collar unionized manufacturing job or climb to the top of a white collar bureaucracy that offered job security, relatively high salaries, and long, stable career ladders."
This was always half myth.
Setting out for the Western Territory was expensive.
Covered wagons were not cheap.
"Even in the first post-WWII generation, only a minority of Americans – a largely white, male minority – found well-paying stable jobs at large, unionized, capital-intensive manufacturing companies like GM, GE, or AT&T."
"But if this story was half myth, it was also half true, particularly in the years after WWII."
"Largely independent of education or family, those Americans who did value stability and security could grasp it in the form of jobs with “a future.”"
"Even for those not so lucky, economic risks were usually fairly low: the unemployment rate for married men during the 1960’s averaged 2.7%, and finding a new job was a relatively simple matter."
"It was during this era – roughly from 1948 to 1973 – that sociologists found that a majority of Americans had come to define themselves not as working class, but as middle class."
"The post-WWII period stands as a reference point in America’s collective memory, but it was in all likelihood an aberration."
"In the early postwar decades, foreign competition exerted virtually no pressure on the economy, owing to the isolation of America’s continental market from the devastation of WWII."
"At the same time, the war left enormous pent-up demand for the products of mass production: cars, washing machines, refrigerators, lawn mowers, television sets, and more."
"Government policy back then began with a permanent military program of spending and R&D and continued through massive public works program and suburbanization, underpinned by the Federal Highway Program and subsidized home ownership loans from the Federal Housing Administration."
"The regulatory institutions and behavioral norms that originated in the New Deal and developed during WWII came into full force: social security, a system of unionized labor relations, market regulation."
"Favorable macroeconomic circumstances, the absence of foreign competition, a system of government support and regulation, and large-scale private provision of what in Europe would have been public social insurance all combined to give post-WWII America many of social democracy’s benefits without the costs."
The economy did not stagger under the weight of ample benefits or high taxes.
"Americans – at least white, male Americans – did not have to worry about tradeoffs between security and opportunity, because the US offered the advantages of both."
Corporate welfare capitalism substituted for what in Europe would have been government provided social democracy.
America was thus a special place.
"It had its cake and ate it, too: a combination of security with opportunity and entrepreneurship."
It seemed that this was the natural order of things.
Hence there was little pressure for government-sponsored social democracy: Why bother? What would it add?
Now things are very different.
The typical American employer is no longer General Motors. It is Wal-Mart.
"Private businesses are providing their workers with less and less in the form of defined-benefit pensions, health insurance, and other forms of insurance against life’s economic risks."
Sharply rising income inequality has raised the stakes of the economic game.
A government that cannot balance its own finances cannot be relied on to provide macroeconomic stability.
"Indeed, former Chairman of the US Federal Reserve Paul Volcker sees the US as so macroeconomically vulnerable as to be running a 75% chance of a full-fledged dollar crisis over the next several years."
The coming generation will be one of massive downward mobility for many Americans.
"The political struggles that this generates will determine whether America will move more closely to the social democratic norm for developed countries, or find some way to accept and rationalize its existence as a country of high economic risk and deep divisions of income and wealth."
Syria and September 11
"PARIS – By chance, it appears that the US Congress will decide on or around September 11 whether to endorse President Barack Obama’s proposal to respond militarily to the Syrian government’s use of poison gas against civilians."
"The shadow of two previous events that took place on September 11 looms over the outcome – indeed, over the fact that the question is even being considered at all."
"Long before September 11 became a day of infamy in the United States, it acquired similar significance in Chile, where 40 years ago, on September 11, 1973, the armed forces, led by General Augusto Pinochet, overthrew the country’s democratically elected government."
"More than any other event of our era, that violent coup was responsible for launching both the contemporary global movement for human rights and the American movement to promote human rights internationally."
"In part, this reflected the new regime’s cruelty."
"More than three thousand people were murdered or “disappeared” during Pinochet’s rule, thousands more were tortured by his forces, and tens of thousands were forcibly exiled."
"To an even greater extent, however, the motivation that spurred the human-rights movement was revulsion worldwide, including in the US, against American aid to Pinochet’s forces, a policy directed by President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger."
"In the US, members of Congress turned the coup into a platform for efforts to promote human rights."
"They condemned developments in Chile, held hearings about the importance of promoting human rights, and adopted legislation – over President Gerald Ford’s veto – requiring that human-rights standards guide US foreign policy."
A slightly revised version of that legislation remains in force.
Obama’s proclamation that the use of chemical weapons in Syria would cross a “red line” – and his implicit threat to use force if that line were crossed – reflects the commitment that the US has made during the past four decades to promote human rights worldwide.
"The events of September 11, 2001, are also playing a crucial role in deciding the question of a punitive strike against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime."
One consequence of the terrorist attacks 12 years ago is that Americans and others in the West became aware that developments in the Middle East could affect their own safety and security.
"Initially, the attacks unleashed a strong desire to retaliate, which later gave way to caution about intervention, owing to unforeseen consequences."
"In Britain, continuing intense resentment over the deceptions that led to the country’s engagement in the Iraq war seems to be the main reason for Parliament’s refusal to back a strike against Syria."
Wariness of another Middle East war has also underpinned Obama’s unwillingness to go beyond a one-time punitive strike on Syria – with some in Congress opposed to even that.
"Though Congress must guard against repeating its disastrous mistake in 2003, when it supported the war in Iraq, the commitment to promote human rights that the US made following September 11, 1973, seems a more appropriate standard for weighing Obama’s proposal for US military action in Syria."
Maintaining the international prohibition on the use of chemical weapons is an urgent concern.
The Assad regime’s culpability for using these weapons is not in doubt.
"If the US Congress deals with Obama’s proposal responsibly, and does not yield to those motivated by a partisan desire to embarrass him at every turn, it will enhance its own claim to recapture the constitutional power to authorize military conflict – a power that has been disregarded more often than not in the past half-century."
A critical part of its role must be to consider with care the limits that should be placed on a punitive strike.
"The war in Iraq was misconceived from the start, because it was an attempt to avenge the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks by invading and occupying a country that had no part in them."
"Obama’s proposal to strike Syria, by contrast, is an attempt to enforce an important human-rights norm by directly punishing – through means that do not involve invasion and occupation – those who committed a gross violation."
"It restores human rights to the central place in American foreign policy set forth after September 11, 1973."
America\u0027s Crisis Election
"CAMBRIDGE – On November 4, Americans will elect their 44th president amidst the worst financial turmoil the country has known since the onset of the Great Depression in 1929. Both candidates are United States senators with little experience as executives, so their ability to manage the crisis has become a central issue in the election."
"At the beginning of the campaign, many observers predicted that Iraq would be the major issue in 2008."
"Instead, it is the financial crisis."
"In principle, this should help Barack Obama and the Democrats, because polls show them stronger on economic issues, whereas Republicans and John McCain do better on security issues."
"After the Republican convention, polls showed McCain ahead in early September, but after the financial meltdown, Obama took the lead."
"Although both men have warily embraced the $700 billion bailout of the financial sector, the contrasts between the two men are sharp."
"Obama is not only the first African-American nominee of a major party, but also one of the youngest candidates ever."
McCain has experience as a naval aviator and more than two decades in the Senate.
"If elected, he would be the oldest incoming president."
The two men differ in temperament as well as experience.
"McCain is a man of strong traditional values who prides himself on his willingness to act quickly and decisively, which he sought to do during the negotiations on the bailout by suspending his campaign to return to Washington."
"That effort appears to have backfired, because the Republicans that he leads initially balked at passing the legislation."
But McCain has shown himself to be resilient.
"In 2007, many people wrote off his campaign, but he had the skills to resurrect it and capture the Republican nomination."
His choice of Alaska’s Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate shook up the presidential campaign.
"Obama, while an inspirational orator, has shown a cool and calm demeanor in responding to both the financial crisis and the turbulence of political campaigning."
"When embarrassed by comments made by the pastor of his church, he delivered an exceptional speech about race in America."
"If anything, some of Obama’s Democratic supporters wish he would show more emotion in responding to criticism."
"One should be careful, however, about reading too much into national opinion polls measuring the candidates’ popular support."
American presidents are elected by an Electoral College in which each state votes in proportion to the number of members it has in Congress.
"Since even the smallest states have two senators, this leads to overrepresentation of lightly populated Western states that tend to vote Republican."
"In 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote, but George W. Bush prevailed in the electoral college."
"Thus, the two candidates’ campaigns are focusing heavily on a dozen or so states in which voters are closely divided and could sway the electoral college outcome."
Each campaign is now desperately trying to gauge the impact of the financial crisis on these battleground states.
"Not only does the Electoral College confuse predictions based on national opinion polls, but there is also the possibility of surprises which can lead to last-minute reversals."
"A mistake in a presidential debate can turn the tide of public opinion overnight, as happened to President Gerald Ford in his debate with Jimmy Carter in 1976."
"Conversely, Ronald Reagan’s performance in his debate with Carter in 1980 is often credited with his victory."
"Another event that could turn the tables would be an “October surprise” associated with terrorism, which could switch the agenda from the financial crisis back to security, the Republicans’ stronger suit."
"In 2004, shortly before the election, Osama bin Laden released a video tape that may have helped President Bush defeat Senator John Kerry."
"From bin Laden’s point of view, Bush’s policies were more useful for his efforts to recruit supporters than Kerry’s might have been."
One would assume that Obama would prove even more unsettling to bin Laden.
"A recent BBC poll of 22 countries found that if the world could vote, Obama would win in a landslide."
The pro-Obama margin varied from 82% in Kenya (where Obama’s father was born) to 9% in India.
But Americans do not like outside interference in their elections.
"When Obama attracted a crowd of 200,000 to a speech in Berlin last summer, Republicans criticized him as an elitist who appeals to crowds overseas but not to blue-collar workers at home."
"On the other hand, in a September poll that asked Americans to rate a series of foreign-policy goals for the next president, 83% ranked “improving America’s standing in the world” as most important."
And certainly the election of the first African-American as president would do wonders to restore the soft power that the Bush administration squandered over the past eight years.
"Some people worry that Obama might be good for American soft power, but not for its hard power."
Machiavelli famously said that it is more important for a prince to be feared than to be loved.
"Machiavelli may be correct, but we sometimes forget that the opposite of love is not fear, but hatred."
And Machiavelli made it clear that hatred is something a prince should carefully avoid.
"When the exercise of hard power undercuts soft power, it makes leadership more difficult – as Bush found out after the invasion of Iraq."
"Both McCain and Obama possess impressive hard-power political and organizational skills; otherwise, they would not be where they are today."
"But when it comes to the soft power skills of emotional intelligence, vision, and communication, Obama outranks McCain."
Whether that will sway American voters wary of financial turmoil on November 4 remains to be seen.
America’s Crony Capitalism
"Buenos Aires – For 20 years, Americans have denounced the “crony capitalism” of Third World countries, especially in Asia."
"But, just as those regions have been improving their public and corporate governance – Hong Kong just witnessed a breakthrough court decision against a telecom tycoon who is the son of the province’s richest and most powerful man – crony capitalism is taking root in the United States, a country that the world long considered the gold standard of a level playing field in business."
"The recently completed “stress tests” of US banks are but the latest indication that crony capitalists have now captured Washington, DC."
"It is no surprise that stock markets liked the results of the stress tests that US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner administered to America’s big banks, for the general outcome had been leaked weeks before."
"Indeed, most professional investors trashed the tests as dishonest even as their holdings benefited from a rising market."
"Even The Wall Street Journal , usually financial markets’ loudest cheerleader, openly disparaged the tests’ integrity."
"The government had allowed bankers to “negotiate” the results, like a student taking a final examination and then negotiating her grade."
The tests were supposed to reveal the true conditions of banks saddled with unaudited toxic assets in housing loans and financial derivatives.
The reasoning behind the tests seemed unimpeachable.
But was it?
"As any seasoned banker knows, a well-managed bank should undertake internal “stress tests” regularly as a matter of good housekeeping."
"The financial crisis should have mandated a running stress test to keep senior management up to date daily. Why, then, did the US need the government to conduct a financial exercise that bankers themselves could and should have done far better and faster?"
The truth is that the tests were not designed to find answers.
Both Wall Street’s chieftains and the Obama administration already knew the truth.
"They knew that if the true conditions at many big banks were publicly revealed, many would have been immediately declared bankrupt, necessitating government receivership to stop a tsunami of bank runs."
"But the Obama administration did not want to be tagged as “socialist” for nationalizing banks, however temporarily, even though experts such as former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker had recommended just that."
"Moreover, nationalizing banks would have required dismissing Wall Street captains and their boards for grossly mismanaging their firms."
"Wall Street’s titans, however, had convinced Obama and his team that their continued stewardship was essential to getting the world out of its crisis. They successfully portrayed themselves as victims of a firestorm, rather than as accessories to arson."
"Geithner and Larry Summers, Obama’s chief economic advisor, share Wall Street’s culture as protégés of Robert Rubin, the former treasury secretary who went on to serve as a director and senior counselor at Citigroup."
Neither man found it difficult to accept the bankers’ absurd logic.
The stress tests were meant to signal to the public that there was no immediate threat of bank failures.
"This message, it was hoped, would stabilize the market so that prices for “toxic” assets could rise to a level at which bankers might feel comfortable selling them."
"After all, senior bankers had been claiming that these assets were “mispriced,” and that pricing them at market levels would penalize the banks unnecessarily."
"So far, Geithner seems to have succeeded in his “tests,” as the stock market has indeed more than stabilized, with prices of bank shares such as Citigroup and Bank of America quadrupling from their lows."
The feared implosion of Wall Street seems to have been avoided.
"But no one ever seriously thought that the US would allow Citigroup and Bank of America, to name just two, to fail."
"In fact, the stock market bottomed out last winter."
Markets had factored into share prices the belief that the US government would not allow any more banks to collapse.
What the world wanted was an accurate picture of what the banks were worth and “mark-to-market” valuations to guide investors as to how much new capital they needed.
The world also wanted to see the US retaking the high road in reinforcing business ethics and integrity – so lacking under the last administration.
"As taxpayers had already put huge sums into rescuing failing banks, with the prospect of more to come, a transparent process to reveal how the money was being used was imperative."
"Substantial public rescue funds have reportedly been siphoned off to foreign banks, Goldman Sachs, and staff bonuses for purposes unrelated to protecting public interests."
None of this was either revealed or debunked by Geithner’s tests.
"Instead, public servants now appear to be in cahoots with Wall Street to engineer an artificial aura of profitability."
"Moreover, the value of toxic assets remains as murky as ever."
Once sacrosanct accounting principles have been amended at Wall Street’s behest in order to allow banks to report essentially whatever they want.
And now negotiated stress test results have been released to “prove” that the banks are a lot healthier.
Calling this a Ponzi scheme might be too harsh. But few financial professionals have been fooled.
"Meanwhile, Wall Street chieftains and their boards of directors have nothing to fear from government."
"On the contrary, they are now the government’s partners in a joint venture to manage this dishonest scheme."
"Like swine flu, crony capitalism has migrated from corrupt Third World countries to America, once the citadel of sound public and private governance."
"Is it any wonder that China is perceived as an increasingly credible model for much of the developing world, while the US is now viewed as a symbol of hypocrisy and double standards?"
America’s Dangerous Debt Ceiling Debate
"NEWPORT BEACH – It has been raised more than 70 times in the last 50 years, mostly without commotion. It must be raised again this summer if the United States government is to continue paying its bills on time."
"But now America’s debt ceiling has become the subject of intense political posturing and touch-and-go negotiations behind closed doors. And, obviously, the outcome has implications that go well beyond the US."
"As part of America’s system of checks and balances, Congress gets to do more than just approve the annual federal budget. It also sets a limit on how much debt the US Treasury is allowed to issue."
"Beyond this ceiling, the government can spend only from current revenues."
US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner recently informed members of Congress that the government will be in this situation on or around August 2.
"Having already officially hit the ceiling, the Treasury is moving money around and tapping various pots of unused funds to pay its bills."
"In a few weeks, this “flexibility” will be used up."
"With the US government now borrowing around 40% of every dollar it spends, a truly binding debt ceiling would immediately force the government to reduce spending radically and in a disorderly fashion."
"Politicians across the political spectrum know that such a situation would unsettle an already fragile US economy, severely weaken the dollar, and raise serious concerns about the country's ability to meet its debt-service obligations, including to the many foreign creditors that the US will need in the future."
"Yet, in today’s polarized environment in Washington, Republicans and Democrats are unwilling to compromise – or at least to compromise “too early.”"
"By holding out, Republicans wish to force President Barack Obama’s administration into massive spending cuts."
Democrats respond that such a one-sided approach would be economically harmful and socially unjust.
"In the meantime, both sides risk disrupting transfer payments (including to the elderly) and the provision of public services, as well as eroding further America’s global credit standing."
The overwhelming – and sensible – expectation is that the two parties will compromise and raise the debt ceiling before inflicting serious economic and financial dislocations.
The most recent precedent was the bipartisan agreement reached earlier this year on another fiscal issue that threatened to disrupt the normal functioning of government: the absence of a formally approved budget for this year.
"A compromise would allow both parties to declare partial victory, for it would likely entail commitments to cut spending and some steps to make taxation more socially just. But, like many last-minute agreements, it would have little durable impact."
"In effect, the political system would again be kicking the can down the road, with real progress on necessary fiscal reforms expected only after the November 2012 presidential election."
"Two scenarios for the timing of an interim compromise are possible, depending on whether it is a one- or two-step process."
"Most observers expect a one-step process for bipartisan agreement before August 2. But politicians may need two steps: an initial failure to agree, and then a quick deal in response to the resulting financial-market convulsions."
"In the meantime, the Treasury would temporarily re-prioritize and slow outgoing payments."
"This two-step process would be similar to what happened in 2008, when Congress was confronted with another cliffhanger: the Bush administration’s request for $700 billion to prevent a financial-market collapse and an economic depression."
"Congress initially rejected the measure, but a dramatic 770-point drop in the stock market focused politicians’ minds, bringing them back to the table – and to agreement."
"But the two-step scenario involves incremental risks to the US economy, and to its standing in the global system. And the longer America’s politicians take to resolve the debt-ceiling issue, the greater the risk of an inadvertent accident."
"This brings us to a third, and even more unsettling possibility: a longer and more protracted negotiation, resulting in greater disruptions to government entitlement payments, other contractual obligations, and public services."
"Creditors would then ask many more questions before adding to their already-considerable holdings of US government debt, generating still more headwinds in a US economy that already faces an unemployment crisis and uneven growth."
The next few weeks will provide plenty of political drama.
"The baseline expectation, albeit subject to risk, is that Democrats and Republicans will find a way to avoid disruptions that would damage the fragile US economy, but that the compromise will not meaningfully address the need for sensible medium-term fiscal reforms."
"Such political paralysis on key economic issues is increasingly unsettling for the US private sector, and for other countries that rely on a strong US at the core of the global economy."
"This helps to explain why so many companies continue to hoard cash, rather than investing domestically, and why a growing number of countries want to diversify gradually away from dependence on the dollar as the reserve currency and on US financial markets for intermediation of their hard-earned savings."
"The world economy is hard-wired to the assumption of a strong America, and Americans benefit from this. But the more their politicians argue over the debt ceiling, the greater the risk that the wiring will become irreparably frayed."
America’s Day of Reckoning
The pessimists who have long forecasted that America’s economy was in for trouble finally seem to be coming into their own.
"Of course, there is no glee in seeing stock prices tumble as a result of soaring mortgage defaults."
"But it was largely predictable, as are the likely consequences for both the millions of Americans who will be facing financial distress and the global economy."
The story goes back to the recession of 2001.
"With the support of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, President George W. Bush pushed through a tax cut designed to benefit the richest Americans but not to lift the economy out of the recession that followed the collapse of the Internet bubble."
"Given that mistake, the Fed had little choice if it was to fulfill its mandate to maintain growth and employment: it had to lower interest rates, which it did in an unprecedented way – all the way down to 1%."
"It worked, but in a way fundamentally different from how monetary policy normally works."
"Usually, low interest rates lead firms to borrow more to invest more, and greater indebtedness is matched by more productive assets."
"But, given that overinvestment in the 1990’s was part of the problem underpinning the recession, lower interest rates did not stimulate much investment."
"The economy grew, but mainly because American families were persuaded to take on more debt, refinancing their mortgages and spending some of the proceeds."
"And, as long as housing prices rose as a result of lower interest rates, Americans could ignore their growing indebtedness."
"In fact, even this did not stimulate the economy enough."
"To get more people to borrow more money, credit standards were lowered, fueling growth in so-called “subprime” mortgages."
"Moreover, new products were invented, which lowered upfront payments, making it easier for individuals to take bigger mortgages."
"Some mortgages even had negative amortization: payments did not cover the interest due, so every month the debt grew more."
"Fixed mortgages, with interest rates at 6%, were replaced with variable-rate mortgages, whose interest payments were tied to the lower short-term T-bill rates."
"What were called “teaser rates” allowed even lower payments for the first few years: they were teasers, because they played off the fact that many borrowers were not financially sophisticated, and didn’t really understand what they were getting into."
And Alan Greenspan egged them to pile on the risk by encouraging these variable-rate mortgages.
"On February 23, 2004, he pointed out that “many homeowners might have saved tens of thousands of dollars had they held adjustable-rate mortgages rather than fixed-rate mortgages during the past decade.”"
But did Greenspan really expect interest rates to remain permanently at 1% – a negative real interest rate?
"Did he not think about what would happen to poor Americans with variable-rate mortgages if interest rates rose, as they almost surely would?"
"Of course, Greenspan’s behavior meant that under his watch, the economy performed better than it otherwise would have."
But it was only a matter of time before that performance became unsustainable.
"Fortunately, most Americans did not follow Greenspan’s advice to switch to variable-rate mortgages."
"But even as short-term interest rates began to rise, the day of reckoning was postponed, as new borrowers could obtain fixed-rate mortgages at interest rates that were not increasing."
"Remarkably, as short-term interest rates rose, medium- and long-term interest rates did not, something that was referred to as a “conundrum.”"
"One hypothesis is that foreign central banks that were accumulating trillions of dollars finally figured out that they were likely to be holding these reserves for years to come, and could afford to put at least some of the money into medium-term US treasury notes yielding (initially) far higher returns than T-bills."
"The housing price bubble eventually broke, and, with prices declining, some have discovered that their mortgages are larger than the value of their house."
"Others found that as interest rates rose, they simply could not make their payments."
"Too many Americans built no cushion into their budgets, and mortgage companies, focusing on the fees generated by new mortgages, did not encourage them to do so."
"Just as the collapse of the real estate bubble was predictable, so are its consequences: housing starts and sales of existing homes are down and housing inventories are up."
"By some reckonings, more than two-thirds of the increase in output and employment over the past six years has been real estate-related, reflecting both new housing and households borrowing against their homes to support a consumption binge."
The housing bubble induced Americans to live beyond their means – net savings has been negative for the past couple of years.
"With this engine of growth turned off, it is hard to see how the American economy will not suffer from a slowdown."
"A return to fiscal sanity will be good in the long run, but it will reduce aggregate demand in the short run."
There is an old adage about how people’s mistakes continue to live long after they are gone.
That is certainly true of Greenspan.
"In Bush’s case, we are beginning to bear the consequences even before he has departed."
America’s Deepening Moral Crisi
NEW YORK – America’s political and economic crisis is set to worsen following the upcoming November elections.
President Barack Obama will lose any hope for passing progressive legislation aimed at helping the poor or the environment.
"Indeed, all major legislation and reforms are likely to be stalemated until 2013, following a new presidential election. An already bad situation marked by deadlock and vitriol is likely to worsen, and the world should not expect much leadership from a bitterly divided United States."
"Much of America is in a nasty mood, and the language of compassion has more or less been abandoned."
"Both political parties serve their rich campaign contributors, while proclaiming that they defend the middle class."
"Neither party even mentions the poor, who now officially make up 15% of the population but in fact are even more numerous, when we count all those households struggling with health care, housing, jobs, and other needs."
The Republican Party recently issued a “Pledge to America” to explain its beliefs and campaign promises.
"The document is filled with nonsense, such as the fatuous claim that high taxes and over-regulation explain America’s high unemployment."
It is also filled with propaganda.
"A quotation by President John F. Kennedy states that high tax rates can strangle the economy, but Kennedy’s was speaking a half-century ago, when the top marginal tax rates were twice what they are today."
"Most of all, the Republican platform is devoid of compassion."
America today presents the paradox of a rich country falling apart because of the collapse of its core values.
American productivity is among the highest in the world.
"Average national income per person is about $46,000 – enough not only to live on, but to prosper."
Yet the country is in the throes of an ugly moral crisis.
"Income inequality is at historic highs, but the rich claim that they have no responsibility to the rest of society."
"They refuse to come to the aid of the destitute, and defend tax cuts at every opportunity."
"Almost everybody complains, almost everybody aggressively defends their own narrow and short-term interests, and almost everybody abandons any pretense of looking ahead or addressing the needs of others."
"What passes for American political debate is a contest between the parties to give bigger promises to the middle class, mainly in the form of budget-busting tax cuts at a time when the fiscal deficit is already more than 10% of GDP."
Americans seem to believe that they have a natural right to government services without paying taxes.
"In the American political lexicon, taxes are defined as a denial of liberty."
"There was a time, not long ago, when Americans talked of ending poverty at home and abroad."
"Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty in the mid-1960’s reflected an era of national optimism and the belief that society should make collective efforts to solve common problems, such as poverty, pollution, and health care."
"America in the 1960’s enacted programs to rebuild poor communities, to fight air and water pollution, and to ensure health care for the elderly."
"Then the deep divisions over Vietnam and civil rights, combined with a surge of consumerism and advertising, seemed to end an era of shared sacrifice for the common good."
"For 40 years, compassion in politics receded."
Ronald Reagan gained popularity by cutting social benefits for the poor (claiming that the poor cheated to receive extra payments).
Bill Clinton continued those cuts in the 1990’s.
"Today, no politician even dares to mention help for poor people."
The big campaign contributors to both parties pay to ensure that their vested interests dominate political debates.
"That means that both parties increasingly defend the interests of the rich, though Republicans do so slightly more than Democrats."
Even a modest tax increase on the rich is unlikely to find support in American politics.
"The result of all of this is likely to be a long-term decline of US power and prosperity, because Americans no longer invest collectively in their common future."
"America will remain a rich society for a long time to come, but one that is increasingly divided and unstable."
"Fear and propaganda may lead to more US-led international wars, as in the past decade."
And what is happening in America is likely to be repeated elsewhere.
America is vulnerable to social breakdown because it is a highly diverse society.
"Racism and anti-immigrant sentiments are an important part of the attack on the poor, or at least the reason why so many are willing to heed the propaganda against helping the poor."
"As other societies grapple with their own increasing diversity, they may follow the US into crisis."
"Swedes recently gave enough votes to a right-wing, anti-immigrant party to give it representation in parliament, reflecting a growing backlash against the rising number of immigrants in Swedish society."
"In France, Nicolas Sarkozy’s government has tried to regain popularity with the working class by deporting Roma migrants, a target of widespread hatred and ethnic attacks."
"Both examples show that Europe, like the US, is vulnerable to the politics of division, as our societies become more ethnically diverse."
The lesson from America is that economic growth is no guarantee of wellbeing or political stability.
"American society has become increasingly harsh, where the richest Americans buy their way to political power, and the poor are abandoned to their fate."
"In their private lives, Americans have become addicted to consumerism, which drains their time, savings, attention, and inclination to engage in acts of collective compassion."
The world should beware.
"Unless we break the ugly trends of big money in politics and rampant consumerism, we risk winning economic productivity at the price of our humanity."
America’s Economic Stalemate
CAMBRIDGE – The United States appears trapped in a dangerous economic stalemate.&#160;
The refusal by both Republicans and Democrats to give ground on the budget is preventing the government from dealing with its massive fiscal deficit and rapidly rising national debt.
"Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the national debt could increase to 82% of GDP over the next ten years – more than double the debt ratio as recently as 2008."
"That forecast, moreover, is based on quite optimistic assumptions of strong economic growth and low interest rates."
"With slower growth and more normal interest rates, the debt ratio could easily rise to more than 100% in 2021, and exceed 150% by 2030."
A major reason for the accelerating growth in government debt is America’s rapidly aging population and the resulting increase in the cost of the universal pension and health-care programs – Social Security and Medicare.
Most experts believe that limiting the rise in debt will require slowing the growth of these “entitlement” programs and increasing taxes as a share of GDP.
"But President Barack Obama and the congressional Democrats oppose any reduction in future entitlement programs, while the Republican presidential candidates and their party’s congressional delegation oppose any increase in tax revenues."
The result is the current stalemate in reducing the fiscal deficit and reversing the growth of the national debt.
Republicans argue that the national debt’s growth should be limited only by cutting government spending.
"Although some cuts in traditional outlays should be part of efforts to rein in spending, this approach should be supplemented by reducing “tax expenditures” – the special features of the tax code that subsidize health care, mortgage borrowing, local-government taxes, etc.. Limiting tax expenditures could reduce the annual deficit by as much as 2% of GDP, thereby reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2021 by more than 25 percentage points."
"Republicans generally reject this form of spending reduction, because it results in additional tax revenue."
"While this method does indeed increase total revenue, the economic effect of limiting tax expenditures is the same as it is under any other method of cutting spending on those programs."
But the Republicans’ opposition to anything that raises revenue means that this key to breaking the budget stalemate won’t be implemented.
The budget cost of Social Security pensions could be gradually reduced by substituting annuities generated by investment-based personal retirement accounts for part of the current tax-financed benefits.
"But even though such a reform could maintain income levels for retirees, Democrats oppose it, because it lowers traditional government benefits."
This reinforces the stalemate.
The two parties’ hardline stances anticipate the upcoming congressional and presidential elections in November 2012.
"The Republicans, in effect, face the voters with a sign that says, “We won’t raise your taxes, but the Democrats will.”"
"The Democrats’ sign, by contrast, says, “We won’t reduce your pension or health benefits, but the Republicans will.”"
"Neither side wants any ambiguity in their message before the election, thus ruling out the possibility of any immediate changes in tax expenditures or future Social Security pensions."
"But, for the same reason, I am optimistic that the stalemate will end after the election."
"At that point, both Republicans and Democrats will be able to accept reforms that they must reject now."
Another post-election route to deficit reduction would be to lower marginal tax rates and balance that revenue loss with cuts in tax expenditures.
"Official analyses downplay the effect of lower marginal tax rates on taxable income, but experience shows that taxable income rises substantially as taxpayers respond to lower marginal rates by working more, taking more of their compensation in taxable cash than in fringe benefits, and reducing their tax-deductible consumption."
Reducing tax expenditures while lowering marginal tax rates can produce substantial revenue by increasing the level of taxable income.&#160;
"The current economic stalemate is troubling, because financial markets could react adversely, and because delays in addressing the fiscal deficit means a higher national debt. I may be too optimistic, but I think there is good reason to believe that the current budget stalemate reflects election posturing, and that the US political system will prove more effective at making progress on fiscal consolidation once the election is past."
America’s Election and the Global Economy
"STANFORD – As America’s elections approach, with President Barack Obama slightly in front of his Republican challenger, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, pollsters still rate the races for control of the presidency and the United States Senate too close to call, with the House of Representatives likely to remain in Republican hands."
"The differences between the candidates are considerable, and highly consequential for American economic policy and the global economy, although enactment of their programs will depend on the makeup of Congress."
The most important differences between the two candidates can be summarized as follows:
Spending.
Obama has dramatically increased spending.
"He would likely continue many of his temporary programs (as Milton Friedman once observed, “There is nothing so permanent as a temporary government program.”); double down on having government pick winners and losers in green energy; expand spending on education and infrastructure; and substantially reduce defense expenditures."
"Romney, by contrast, favors limiting overall federal spending, currently 24% of GDP, to 20%, and keeping defense at 4%."
"He wants private markets, not government, to choose winning firms and technologies."
"Democrats oppose most nondefense spending cuts, arguing that reductions would cause the economy to contract."
That case is strongest if the spending reductions are large and abrupt in a weak economy.
"If phased in over a multi-year period as the economy recovers, as Romney proposes, thrift would likely be expansionary."
"For example, federal spending relative to GDP fell by five percentage points from the mid-1980’s to the late 1990’s in the US, and by an even larger margin in recent decades in Canada – that is, through periods of strong economic growth."
Taxes.
"Obama would raise the top marginal tax rates on wages, capital gains, dividends, interest, and estates, especially on higher-income individuals and small businesses."
Yet he has never proposed comprehensive reform of either the personal or corporate income tax.
"By contrast, Romney would reduce America’s corporate tax rate (the highest in the OECD) to 25% and tax American multinationals on a territorial, rather than a worldwide, basis in order to increase their tax competitiveness."
"He would also lower personal tax rates by 20%, and make up lost revenue by limiting tax deductions and credits, particularly at the upper end, thereby raising about 18.5% of GDP, just above the historical average, at full employment."
Romney’s fiscal plan thus reduces deficits sufficiently to decrease the debt-to-GDP ratio.
"He favors a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution, and hopes to balance the budget over eight years."
"Obama, by contrast, would run larger deficits – his spending increase is much larger than his tax increase – which imply large tax hikes in the future."
"Moreover, he would run far larger debt ratios than Romney, because the main driver of the debt is entitlement spending."
Entitlements.
"Obama has remained silent about reform of Medicare and Social Security, whose long-run deficits are several times the national debt."
Vice President Joe Biden has even said that “no changes” to Social Security are to be made.
"Romney supports gradually increasing retirement ages, a premium-support model for Medicare, and shifting Medicaid (health insurance for the poor) to the states via block grants."
"The Obama campaign is pummeling Romney on Medicare, and the Romney campaign is hammering Obama for his refusal to negotiate or even propose a solution."
"The Obama policy would thus lead to ever-higher deficits and debt ratios well over 100% of GDP, a level that numerous studies imply would reduce US economic growth by one-third or more and might induce a sovereign-debt crisis."
Some observers suggest that Obama’s unspoken plan is ever-growing entitlements eventually paid for by a European-style value-added tax.
Trade.
Obama is the first US president in a long time who has not played a leading role on global trade liberalization.
"The Doha Round of global trade talks remains stalled, and Obama delayed the three bilateral free-trade agreements that awaited approval when he came into office."
"Romney is a proponent of free trade, but has said that he would be tougher on China’s trade practices and currency policies."
Regulation.
Obama wants to expand federal command-and-control regulation further (though the courts have stopped his extension of some regulatory powers).
"Romney vows an economically balanced approach that would reform Obama’s major health-care, environmental, and financial-services regulations."
Appointments.
"Every US president appoints thousands of officials, many with considerable power."
"Romney has said that he would not reappoint Ben Bernanke as Fed Chairman (likely candidates: economists Glenn Hubbard, Greg Mankiw, John Taylor, and Martin Feldstein)."
"Other presidential appointees exert considerable influence on firms, industries, or the entire economy."
"For example, Obama’s appointees to the obscure National Labor Relations Board tried to prevent Boeing from expanding in South Carolina, despite the state’s anti-union “right to work” legislation."
"These policies would affect US economic growth, the budget deficit, national saving, and hence global trade and capital flows."
"With larger deficits under Obama than under Romney, America would need more capital from Europe, Latin America, and Asia, while higher taxes and debt would impede US growth and thus undermine these regions’ exports."
Obama would steer America in the direction of European social-welfare states; Romney’s agenda is designed to prevent that.
"Whoever wins, a fiscal cliff looms at the end of 2012."
"Previous legislation, if not reversed, will lead to large abrupt tax hikes and spending cuts, which the Congressional Budget Office forecasts would likely cause a recession in 2013."
"While a post-election, lame-duck session of Congress will address the fiscal cliff, the deep differences between Republicans and Democrats on taxes and spending remain wide and difficult to bridge."
"With uncertainty plaguing Europe’s finances and China slowing, the last thing the global economy needs is a stagnant or shrinking US economy."
But it will take strong leadership by the president-elect to avoid it.
America’s Employment and Growth Challenge
"NEW YORK – For many, if not most, Americans, the crisis that befell them in 2008 – leading to slow growth, rising unemployment, and high anxiety among voters – appeared to spring from nowhere."
"Certainly, the vast majority of economists, investment analysts, financial firms, and regulators failed to see the growing risk. In fact, it had deep roots."
"While the precise timing of any crisis is impossible to predict, ample signs of rising risk, distortions, structural problems, and imbalances could be seen by anyone who took the time to interpret a decade’s worth of mounting debt, low savings, surging asset prices, and excess consumption."
The United States was on an unsustainable growth path for at least a decade – probably longer – before the crisis.
"Restoring balance and eliminating the distortions will require time, investment, and structural change, and should be the central focus of America’s economic policy."
The household sector is especially important.
"If the main problem had been confined to excess leverage and risk-taking within the financial sector, the economic shock would have been large, but the recovery quicker."
It was the huge loss of households’ net worth that brought down the real economy (with an assist from the credit squeeze on smaller businesses).
Let’s be clear: elevated savings and reduced consumption relative to pre-crisis levels are likely to be permanent even after households reduce leverage and restore retirement savings – a process that in the US has removed roughly $1 trillion from the demand side of the economy.
"To make up the difference, Americans need to compete effectively for a portion of global demand."
"Does this mean that the US is headed for a “new normal,” rather than a reversion to pre-crisis conditions?"
It does.
"Put bluntly, Americans were living beyond their means for too long."
"With foreign borrowing financing a yawning trade deficit, the US economy as a whole spent more than it earned, which both caused and hid structural problems."
"So the main post-crisis challenge is not to return to the old normal, which was not sustainable, nor is it to recover from a deep balance-sheet recession, but rather to make a structural transition from the old abnormal to a new normal that is sustainable."
This does not mean that recovery of households’ balance sheets can be ignored in the post-crisis period.
The US Federal Reserve has had to carry out a difficult balancing act: with no sign of inflation on the horizon – and at least some risk of deflation – it has maintained low interest rates even as credit conditions have eased.
"Contrary to most commentary, this is not a growth strategy, but rather an attempt to limit the considerable risk of another major downturn, induced by further balance-sheet damage in the housing sector."
"True, low interest rates, together with a second round of quantitative easing, are causing considerable global distortions, as funds flow into fast-growing emerging markets, fueling inflationary pressure and asset bubbles."
"But, given the US housing market’s fragility, raising interest rates could cause prices to plummet, sinking the economy again. Despite their complaints, it is not clear that emerging economies would prefer another deep US downturn to the current flood of inbound capital that that they must manage."
"As it is, deficient consumption and stubbornly high unemployment are likely to be with Americans for some time."
"But this is not how the future was sold to the public, and, until recently, financial markets were acting as if recovery was at hand and would be relatively quick."
"The proverbial dead-cat bounce – when freefall stops and inventories run out, causing output to pick up a bit – was misinterpreted as evidence of a V-shaped recovery: sharply down and sharply back up."
"Despite the impression created, particularly in the US, by media commentary and political debate, fiscal stimulus clearly helped in the crisis, though its impact is diminishing rapidly."
"Recent studies by the International Monetary Fund indicate that in most advanced countries, including the US, the growth in budget deficits was largely automatic, owing far more to declining tax revenues and rising expenditures on unemployment benefits than to stimulus spending."
"The appropriate timing of fiscal retrenchment is, in fact, difficult to decide."
On one side is concern about another downturn and deflation.
"On the other side is the risk of excessive debt, currency instability, and – where unemployment is structural – doubts about the benefits of additional stimulus."
"Indeed, advanced countries, including the US, have dug themselves into a deep hole."
"It is not yet a hole of the type one finds in Greece, where restoring fiscal balance and reviving economic growth are probably impossible without a restructuring of public debt."
But climbing out will be difficult and painful.
"At this stage, the best course would be to adopt a credible multi-year plan, based on reasonable but conservative growth assumptions, to reduce deficits to sustainable levels and limit the accumulation of public debt."
"With a new, more hostile Congress, and with members of a new economic team coming on board, Obama’s challenge is to build a consensus around a medium- and long-term recovery strategy, with a focus on restoring growth and employment."
The limited fiscal resources that are available should be targeted on areas that affect competitiveness in the tradable sector.
That means forgoing some government services.
"The truth is that all the net employment growth in the US economy over the last 20 years has been in the non-tradable sector, where Americans don’t have to compete."
"Leading drivers of employment growth have been government, health care, and, until the crisis, construction."
"While this is just one part of a much more complex story, it seems unlikely that these and other non-tradable sectors can sustain employment growth in the future."
"With the tradable sector neutralized and the non-tradable sectors maxed out, the economy lacks sufficiently powerful growth engines."
"That must be fixed, which requires that competitiveness become the central focus of longer-term US economic policy – the sooner, the better."
America’s Exceptional Fiscal Conservatism
"WASHINGTON, DC – In most countries, to be “fiscally conservative” means to worry a great deal about the budget deficit and debt levels – and to push these issues to the top of the policy agenda."
"In many eurozone countries today, “fiscal conservatives” are a powerful group, insisting on the need to boost government revenue while bringing spending under control."
"In Great Britain, too, leading Conservatives have recently proved willing to raise taxes and attempted to limit future spending."
The United States is very different in this respect.
"There, leading politicians who choose to call themselves “fiscal conservatives” – such as Paul Ryan, now the Republican Party’s presumptive vice-presidential nominee to run alongside presidential candidate Mitt Romney in November’s election – care more about cutting taxes, regardless of the effect on the federal deficit and total outstanding debt."
"Why do US fiscal conservatives care so little about government debt, relative to their counterparts in other countries?"
It has not always been this way.
"For example, in 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s advisers suggested that he should cut taxes in order to pave the way for his vice president, Richard Nixon, to be elected to the presidency."
"Eisenhower declined, partly because he did not particularly like or trust Nixon, but mostly because he thought it was important to hand over a more nearly balanced budget to his successor."
The framework for US macroeconomic policy changed dramatically when the international monetary system broke down in 1971.
The US could no longer maintain a fixed exchange rate between the dollar and gold – the cornerstone of the postwar Bretton Woods system.
The arrangement collapsed because the US did not want to tighten monetary policy and run more restrictive fiscal policy: keeping US voters happy was understandably more important to President Nixon than maintaining a global system of fixed exchange rates.
"Ironically, however, rather than undermining the predominant international role of the US dollar, the end of Bretton Woods actually boosted its use around the world."
"Much has been written, and many hands wrung, about the dollar’s decline over the last four decades, but the fact remains that holdings of US dollar assets by foreigners today are vastly greater than they were in 1971."
"This turns out to be a mixed blessing, because it has allowed the US to become less careful about its fiscal accounts."
"Foreigners now hold roughly half of all US federal government debt, and they are willing to hold it when it yields a very low return in dollars (and even when the dollar depreciates)."
"In fact, whenever the world looks unstable, investors want to hold more dollar assets – even when the US is the cause of the instability."
"When big US banks are in trouble or Americans are having another debilitating political fight over their public finances, global investors scramble into US Treasuries. Last year’s congressional showdown over the federal debt ceiling may have cost the US its AAA sovereign rating with Standard &amp;"
"Poor’s, but the federal government’s borrowing costs are actually lower now than they were then."
What has America done with this opportunity – arguably the lowest-cost funding in the history of humankind?
"Not much, in terms of productive investment, strengthening education, or maintaining essential infrastructure. But the US has done a great deal in terms of adopting tax cuts that boost consumption relative to income and lower government revenue relative to expenditure."
This is the lasting legacy of the “temporary” tax cuts adopted by George W. Bush’s administration in the early 2000’s.
"And Americans have shifted greatly toward political philosophies – on the right and on the left – that regard public debt merely as a distraction. Or, as former vice president Dick Cheney put it, “Reagan taught us that deficits do not matter” – meaning that Ronald Reagan cut taxes, ran bigger deficits, and did not suffer any adverse political consequences."
"Ryan and members of the Tea Party wing of the Republican Party undoubtedly want to cut the size of the federal government, and they have articulated plans to do this over several decades. But, in the near term, what they promise is primarily tax cuts: their entire practical program is front-loaded in that direction."
The calculation is that this will prove politically popular (probably true) while making it easier to implement spending cuts down the road (less obvious).
The vulnerability caused by higher public debt over the next few decades is simply ignored.
"For example, Ryan supported George W. Bush’s spending spree."
He also supports maintaining defense spending at or near its current level – resisting the cuts that were put in place under the Budget Control Act of 2011.
The assumption here – unstated and highly questionable – is that the US will be able to sell an unlimited amount of government debt at low interest rates for the foreseeable future.
There is no other country in the world where fiscal conservatives would want to be associated with such a high-stakes gamble.
America’s Failed Militarized Foreign Policy
"Many of today’s war zones – including Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, and Sudan – share basic problems that lie at the root of their conflicts."
"They are all poor, buffeted by natural disasters – especially floods, droughts, and earthquakes – and have rapidly growing populations that are pressing on the capacity of the land to feed them."
"And the proportion of youth is very high, with a bulging population of young men of military age (15-24 years)."
All of these problems can be solved only through long-term sustainable economic development.
Yet the United States persists in responding to symptoms rather than to underlying conditions by trying to address every conflict by military means.
It backs the Ethiopian army in Somalia.
It occupies Iraq and Afghanistan.
It threatens to bomb Iran.
It supports the military dictatorship in Pakistan.
None of these military actions addresses the problems that led to conflict in the first place.
"On the contrary, American policies typically inflame the situation rather than solve it."
"Time and again, this military approach comes back to haunt the US."
"The US embraced the Shah of Iran by sending massive armaments, which fell into the hands of Iran’s Revolutionary Government after 1979."
"The US then backed Saddam Hussein in his attack on Iran, until the US ended up attacking Saddam himself."
"The US backed Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan against the Soviets, until the US ended up fighting bin Laden."
"Since 2001 the US has supported Pervez Musharraf in Pakistan with more than $10 billion in aid, and now faces an unstable regime that just barely survives."
US foreign policy is so ineffective because it has been taken over by the military.
Even postwar reconstruction in Iraq under the US-led occupation was run by the Pentagon rather than by civilian agencies.
The US military budget dominates everything about foreign policy.
"Adding up the budgets of the Pentagon, the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the Department of Homeland Security, nuclear weapons programs, and the State Department’s military assistance operations, the US will spend around $800 billion this year on security, compared with less than $20 billion for economic development."
"In a stunning article on aid to Pakistan during the Bush administration, Craig Cohen and Derek Chollet demonstrated the disastrous nature of this militarized approach – even before the tottering Musharraf regime’s latest crackdown."
"They show that even though Pakistan faces huge problems of poverty, population, and environment, 75% of the $10 billion in US aid has gone to the Pakistani military, ostensibly to reimburse Pakistan for its contribution to the “war on terror,” and to help it buy F-16s and other weapons systems."
"Another 16% went straight to the Pakistani budget, no questions asked."
That left less than 10% for development and humanitarian assistance.
"Annual US aid for education in Pakistan has amounted to just $64 million, or $1.16 per school-aged child."
The authors note that “the strategic direction for Pakistan was set early by a narrow circle at the top of the Bush administration and has been largely focused on the war effort rather than on Pakistan’s internal situation.”
"They also emphasize that “US engagement with Pakistan is highly militarized and centralized, with very little reaching the vast majority of Pakistanis.”"
"They quote George Bush as saying, “When [Musharraf] looks me in the eye and says…there won’t be a Taliban and won’t be al-Qaeda, I believe him, you know?”"
This militarized approach is leading the world into a downward spiral of violence and conflict.
"Each new US weapons system “sold” or given to the region increases the chances of expanded war and further military coups, and to the chance that the arms will be turned on the US itself. None of it helps to address the underlying problems of poverty, child mortality, water scarcity, and lack of livelihoods in places like Pakistan’s Northwest Frontier Province, Sudan’s Darfur region, or Somalia."
These places are bulging with people facing a tightening squeeze of insufficient rainfall and degraded pasturelands.
"Naturally, many join radical causes."
"The Bush administration fails to recognize these fundamental demographic and environmental challenges, that $800 billion of security spending won’t bring irrigation to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sudan, and Somalia, and therefore won’t bring peace."
"Instead of seeing real people in crisis, they see caricatures, a terrorist around every corner."
"A more peaceful world will be possible only when Americans and others begin to see things through the eyes of their supposed enemies, and realize that today’s conflicts, having resulted from desperation and despair, can be solved through economic development rather than war."
"We will have peace when we heed the words of President John F. Kennedy, who said, a few months before his death, “For, in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet."
We all breathe the same air.
We all cherish our children’s future. And we are all mortal.”
America’s Financial Leviathan
"BERKELEY – In 1950, finance and insurance in the United States accounted for 2.8% of GDP, according to US Department of Commerce estimates."
"By 1960, that share had grown to 3.8% of GDP, and reached 6% of GDP in 1990."
"Today, it is 8.4% of GDP, and it is not shrinking."
The Wall Street Journal’s Justin Lahart reports that the 2010 share was higher than the previous peak share in 2006.
"Lahart goes on to say that growth in the finance-and-insurance share of the economy has “not, by and large, been a bad thing....Deploying capital to the places where it can be best used helps the economy grow...”"
But if the US were getting good value from the extra 5.6% of GDP that it is now spending on finance and insurance – the extra $750 billion diverted annually from paying people who make directly useful goods and provide directly useful services – it would be obvious in the statistics.
"At a typical 5% annual real interest rate for risky cash flows, diverting that large a share of resources away from goods and services directly useful this year is a good bargain only if it boosts overall annual economic growth by 0.3% – or 6% per 25-year generation."
"There have been many shocks to the US economy over the past couple of generations, and many factors have added to or subtracted from economic growth."
But it is not obvious that the US economy today would be 6% less productive if it had had the finance-insurance system of 1950 rather than the one that prevailed during the past 20 years.
There are five ways that an economy gains from a well-functioning finance-insurance system.
"First, people are no longer as vulnerable to the effects of fires, floods, medical disasters, unemployment, business collapses, sectoral shifts, and so forth, because a well-working finance-insurance system diversifies and thus dissipates some risks, and deals with others by matching those who fear risk with those who can comfortably bear it."
"While it might be true that America’s current finance-insurance system better distributes risk in some sense, it is hard to see how that could be the case, given the experience of investors in equities and housing over the past two decades."
"Second, well-functioning financial systems match large, illiquid investment projects with the relatively small pools of money contributed by individual savers who value liquidity highly."
There has been one important innovation over the past two generations: businesses can now issue high-yield bonds.
"But, given the costs of the bankruptcy process, it has never been clear why a business would rather issue high-yield bonds (besides gaming the tax system), or why investors would rather buy them than take an equity stake."
"Third, improved opportunities to borrow allow one to spend more now, when one is poor, and save more later, when one is rich."
"Households are certainly much more able to borrow, thanks to home-equity loans, credit-card balances, and payday loans."
But what are they really buying?
"Many are not buying the ability to spend when they are poor and save when they are rich, but instead appear to be buying postponement of the “unpleasant financial retrenchment” talk with the other members of their household."
And that is not something you want to buy.
"Fourth, we have seen major improvements in the ease of transactions."
"But, while electronic transactions have made a great deal of financial life much easier, this should have been accompanied by a decrease, not an increase, in the finance share of GDP, just as automated switching in telecommunications led to a decrease in the number of telephone switchboard operators per phone call."
"Indeed, the operations of those parts of the financial system most closely related to technological improvements have slimmed down markedly: consider what has happened to the checking operations of the regional Federal Reserve Banks."
"Finally, better finance should mean better corporate governance."
"Since shareholder democracy does not provide effective control over entrenched, runaway, self-indulgent management, finance has a potentially powerful role to play in ensuring that corporate managers work in the interest of shareholders."
"And a substantial change has indeed occurred over the past two generations: CEOs focus much more attention than they used to on pleasing the stock market, and this is likely to be a good thing."
"Overall, however, it remains disturbing that we do not see the obvious large benefits, at either the micro or macro level, in the US economy’s efficiency that would justify spending an extra 5.6% of GDP every year on finance and insurance."
Lahart cites the conclusion of New York University’s Thomas Philippon that today’s US financial sector is outsized by two percentage points of GDP.
And it is very possible that Philippon’s estimate of the size of the US financial sector’s hypertrophy is too small.
Why has the devotion of a great deal of skill and enterprise to finance and insurance sector not paid obvious economic dividends?
"There are two sustainable ways to make money in finance: find people with risks that need to be carried and match them with people with unused risk-bearing capacity, or find people with such risks and match them with people who are clueless but who have money."
Are we sure that most of the growth in finance stems from a rising share of financial professionals who undertake the former rather than the latter?
America’s First Debt Crisi
CAMBRIDGE – The West is ensnared in a debt crisis.
"The United States, as everyone knows, came perilously close to defaulting on August 2, and Standard &amp;"
Poor’s downgraded US debt from AAA on August 5.
"In Europe, the outgoing head of the European Central Bank recommends more centralized fiscal authority in Europe in order to deal with likely defaults by one or more of Greece, Portugal, and Spain."
"Both Europe and America can learn a lesson hidden in American history, for, lost in the haze of patriotic veneration of America’s founders is the fact that they created a new country during – and largely because of – a crippling debt crisis."
"Today’s crises, one hopes, could be turned into a similar moment of political creativity."
"After independence from Britain in 1783, America’s states refused to repay their Revolutionary War debts."
Some were unable; others were unwilling.
"The country as a whole operated as a loose confederation that, like the European Union today, lacked taxing and other authority."
"It could not solve its financial problems, and eventually those problems – largely recurring defaults – catalyzed the 1787 Philadelphia convention to create a new United States."
"And then, in 1790-1791, Alexander Hamilton, America’s first treasury secretary, resolved the crisis in one of history’s nation-building successes."
Hamilton turned America’s financial wreckage of the 1780’s into prosperity and political coherence in the 1790’s.
To understand Hamilton’s achievement – and thus to appreciate its significance for our own times – we need to understand the scale of the Revolutionary War debt crisis.
Some states lacked the resources to pay.
Others tried to pay but would not levy the taxes needed to do so.
"Others, like Massachusetts, tried to levy taxes, but its citizens refused to pay them."
"Indeed, some tax collectors were met with violence."
"Indebted farmers physically disabled the repayment machinery in many states, most famously in Shay’s Rebellion in Massachusetts."
Even private debt-payment mechanisms via courts didn’t work.
"James Madison, who would become the Constitution’s principal author, couldn’t borrow to buy land in frontier Virginia, because lenders lacked confidence that Virginia courts could enforce repayment."
George Washington bemoaned that America was not a “respectable country.”
He found Shays Rebellion so worrisome that he came out of his first retirement to preside over the 1787 convention.
"Today, the US Constitution’s most noted features are its allocation of power between Congress and the presidency, and its guarantee of individual rights via its first ten amendments."
"But, at the time, its key role was as a government-debt-repayment mechanism."
"The Constitution would create a new national government that could coin stable money, borrow, and repay debts, including the states’ defaulted Revolutionary War borrowings."
"With the Constitution ratified by 1789, Washington became President and appointed Hamilton – still in his thirties – to head the Treasury."
Hamilton had not been a finance person.
"He was Washington’s Chief of Staff during the Revolutionary War and a quick study: when it was time to learn battlefield tactics, he read military manuals; when it was time to become a national leader who understood finance, he read finance books."
"Yet, it was no accident that two military men were key to making the US a “respectable nation” in financial terms."
"Both thought that only a fiscally strong US could have the military prowess needed to defend itself from the European powers, whose return to American soil both men expected."
But getting the dollars to repay the debt was not easy.
There were no entitlements to cut or government funds to re-direct.
Hamilton knew that the wrong kind of taxes would weaken the already-fragile economy.
"He focused taxation on imports and nonessential goods, like whiskey."
"And Hamilton needed Congress to approve the federal government’s assumption of the states’ debts, which at first seemed unlikely."
"Some states, like Virginia, had already paid much of their debt, and others saw their debt as having become a financial game for New York speculators."
"As a result, many states feared federal assumption would mean that their taxes would go to pay northern speculators or to retire the debt of big borrowers, like Massachusetts."
Virginia and several other southern states that owed little or had repaid what they owed voted against Hamilton’s first assumption bill and defeated it.
They were expected to be adamant – an outcome that could well have brought about the young country’s demise.
"Jefferson and Madison, the southern leaders, opposed Hamilton’s assumption plan, and Madison was critical in blocking it in Congress."
But then the three met for dinner and cut a deal.
"Jefferson and Madison did not want the country’s capital to be in the north, and Hamilton reluctantly agreed to support moving it to an area carved out of Virginia or Maryland."
"They, in turn, would secure the votes for the federal government to assume and repay the states’ defaulted debts."
A responsible fiscal state emerged from that grand compromise.
Despite the enormous cost – more than half of the fledgling government’s expenditures in early years went to debt service – the economy shook off the 1780’s depression and entered a growth boom.
Hamilton’s task was both easier and harder than ours is today.
"It was easier, because there were few choices: no income-tax rates to adjust or entitlements to cut."
"And it was harder, because the US was an unknown entity, and there was little reason for confidence in the American non-nation."
Today’s trajectory is the reverse of that of the 1780’s and 1790’s.
"It is hard today for America (and, until recently, the world) to imagine a US default, because there has been no strong reason to fear one since the 1790’s."
Americans today know what must be done: some combination of entitlement cuts and tax increases.
"Europeans, too, know a new balance that needs to be struck."
"But, until Europe and the US find leaders with the authority and willingness to repeat a modern version of the deal-making example set by Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison 200 years ago, their debt problems will continue to weaken their national foundations."
America’s Fiscal Isolationism
"DENVER – Patience might be a virtue, but not necessarily when it comes to American foreign policy."
"Consider “the long war,” a bold concept embraced a few years ago to describe the continuing struggle against terrorism, the grudging progress that could realistically be achieved, and the enormous financial burden that it would impose for years to come."
"It was also a realpolitik acknowledgement of the setbacks to be expected along the way (the “slog,” as then Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld put it)."
"Above all, the term was an effort to communicate to Americans, accustomed to waging war with speed and decisiveness (and insistent on it since Vietnam), the long-term sacrifice and commitment needed to win a war of survival."
"Its proponents also understood that the war would not be limited to weapons, but would need to be a sustained effort, involving, as they put it, the “whole of government,” with civilian agencies marshaled behind military – or paramilitary – objectives."
"Daunting as the effort would be, its advocates assumed a sustainable political consensus to support it."
"After all, the United States had been attacked."
"Today, that consensus is unraveling as America’s politicians wrestle with a federal budget that is itself turning into a long war – one with its own casualties."
"The battle lines in this struggle suggest that there is little accord among political elites for any spending, let alone for a long war with far-flung commitments."
"As a result, basic assumptions are being questioned at every turn."
"Indeed, the current budget war seems to be reopening old divisions about America’s view of itself and the world."
"The outcome is far from certain, but even isolationism, a perennial American malady, seems to be making a comeback."
"Isolationism is a familiar refrain in US foreign policy among those elements of the right that consider the US too good for the world, as well as among those on the left who consider America a destructive global force."
"But this time, as perhaps never before, a bipartisan isolationist impulse is being driven by the budget."
"America’s fiscal crisis is profound, and it is not just about numbers."
"As the emotions in Washington today suggest, the aversion to tax increases runs far deeper than concern about their effect on current economic performance and job growth."
"In part, it represents a fundamental – some would say fundamentalist – view that taxes are to government what a bottle of whisky is to an alcoholic."
"Government, as Ronald Reagan told us, is the problem, not the solution."
That message is bad news for American diplomacy.
"The linkage between politicians’ unwillingness to fund domestic programs and the imperiled commitment to “the long war” might elude those in US foreign-policy circles, but it is not lost on the rest of the country."
"Opinion surveys suggest that Americans want to maintain many of the “discretionary” domestic programs – schools, hospitals, transportation infrastructure, recreational parks, etc. – that are now on the chopping block in budget negotiations."
"In places like rural El Paso County, on the eastern plains of Colorado, far from the federal budget debate’s epicenter, spending cuts are the order of the day."
"School districts are increasing class sizes as they shed teachers, as well as deferring maintenance projects and curtailing the school-bus service."
These cuts are having a very real and immediate impact on El Paso County’s residents.
"Can they, and other Americans who are losing vital services, really be expected to rise above it all and support funding to build new schools in Afghanistan?"
"Not only are America’s public schools starting to look second-rate, but so is its infrastructure, which had long been a source of national pride."
"How many travelers nowadays can fail to note the difference between Asia’s new, efficient airports and the aging, clogged antiques in some major US cities?"
"The budget war is not producing any consensus on fixing America’s infrastructure, but it is beginning to produce a view that Afghanistan and Pakistan are far from being core US national interests."
"Why, people ask, are schools and roads in Afghanistan and Iraq more important than those in Colorado or California?"
"At one point in 2008, the US military picked up the cost of transporting a tiger for the Baghdad zoo."
"When was the last time the US government did that for a US zoo (outside of Washington, of course)?"
How this debate sorts itself out will have profound consequences for how America conducts itself in the world.
But it might also take a toll on how the world reacts to America’s fastest-growing export: unsolicited advice.
Countries take others’ advice for many reasons.
Sometimes they respect the adviser’s wisdom and insights (fairly rare in diplomacy).
"Or they might fear the consequences of not taking the advice (an offer one cannot refuse, so to speak)."
"Or, as is true of many of America’s diplomatic transactions, accepting advice could open the way to a better relationship and to additional assistance."
"In short, diplomacy – and US diplomacy, in particular – often involves money."
But what if there is no money to offer?
"What if Americans, tired of the budget cuts in their neighborhoods, refuse to support funds even for “the long war”?"
"At that point, senior US officials might well arrive in a country, offer advice, and find that nobody is bothering to listen."
America’s Free-Trade Abdication
"NEW YORK – The indifference and apathy that one finds in Washington from both the Congress and President Barack Obama on the Doha Round of world trade talks, and the alarm and concern expressed by statesmen elsewhere over the languishing negotiations, mark the end of the post-1945 era of American leadership on multilateral free trade."
Evidence of anxiety outside the US has been clear to everyone for almost a year.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister David Cameron were concerned enough to join with Turkey’s President Abdullah Gül and Indonesia’s President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in appointing Peter Sutherland and me as Co-Chairs of a High-Level Trade Experts Group in November 2010.
"We held a prestigious Panel at Davos with these leaders in January 2011, where, on the occasion of our Interim Report, we gave full-throated support to concluding Doha."
But there was no response from the US government.
"In September, former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe González, and former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo reminded G-20 leaders that in November 2009, at their first meeting in London, they had expressed “a commitment to …conclude the Round in 2010.”"
"And, two weeks ago, the UN met again on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)."
"Goal 8 is about instruments such as trade and aid, and MDG 8A commits the UN member nations to “[d]evelop further an open, rule-based, predictable, non-discriminatory trading and financial system.”"
"But, while practically every country today has embraced preferential Free Trade Agreements, the recent leader in this proliferation is the US."
"There, Congress and the president apparently have plenty of time to discuss bilateral FTAs with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama, as well as the regional Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), but none for negotiating the non-discriminatory Doha Round, which is languishing in its tenth year of talks."
"Indeed, it is notable that, while Obama’s State of the Union address in January 2010 at least mentioned Doha, his address in January 2011 did not."
Obama confined himself to promoting the pending bilateral agreements with Colombia and other emerging-market countries.
Obama’s regrettable retreat from support for the Doha Round is the result of many factors and fallacies.
"These were highlighted in an “Open Letter to Obama” that I organized and released, over the signatures of nearly 50 of today’s most influential trade experts worldwide, urging a presidential shift in policy towards Doha."
"America’s president is captive to the country’s labor unions, who buy the false narrative that trade with poor countries is increasing the ranks of the poor in the US by driving down wages."
"In fact, however, there is plenty of evidence for the rival narrative that rapid and deep labor-saving technological change is what is putting pressure on wages, and that imports of cheap labor-intensive goods that US workers consume are actually offsetting that distress."
"Again, Washington lobbyists have bought into the absurd claim of trade experts such as Fred Bergsten that the gain from Doha, as it stands now, is a paltry $7 billion or so annually."
"This ignores the far greater losses that a failed Doha Round would entail, for example, by undermining the World Trade Organization’s credibility as the principal guarantor of rules-based trade, and by leaving trade liberalization entirely to discriminatory liberalization under preferential bilateral agreements."
"Again, someone needs to tell Obama that imports create jobs, too, and that his emphasis on promoting US exports alone is bad economics."
"Most of all, Obama is badly served on trade by his senior colleagues."
"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, for example, was opposed to trade liberalization when she ran against Obama for president, and advocated a “pause” in free-trade negotiations."
"She also misinterpreted the great economist Paul Samuelson as a protectionist, when he said nothing of the kind."
She has never recanted.
"Likewise, now that Warren Buffett is considered to be Obama’s most trusted economic adviser, it is worth recalling that back in 2003 he produced the astonishing prescription that the best way to reduce the US trade deficit was to allow no more imports than it could finance from its export earnings."
An amused and alarmed Samuelson drew my attention to this nutty idea.
"While Buffett’s prescription of higher taxes for America’s wealthy is entirely desirable, will Obama realize that a genius in one area may be a dunce in another?"
What we need today is for the world’s leading statesmen to stop pussyfooting and to unite in nudging Obama towards a successful conclusion of the Doha Round.
That alone would provide the counterweight to the forces that pull him in the wrong direction.
It is still not too late.
Obama’s Underachieving Foreign Policy
"PARIS – To evaluate an American president’s foreign-policy performance after one term is challenging, given the complex diplomatic and strategic environment and significant domestic constraints that confront every US president. Nevertheless, in advance of November’s presidential election, it is important to distinguish the forces that have shaped Barack Obama’s foreign policy, and to assess his handling of them."
"Obama kept his promise to withdraw American forces from Iraq during his first term. But the move proved to be a strategic defeat, given that it significantly diminished the United States’ political influence in Iraq."
"Indeed, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki’s government is becoming increasingly allied with Iran."
"Obama, who opposed the Iraq war, should not be blamed for current circumstances there. But he was unable to improve the situation or help Iraq’s Shias and Sunnis reach a political compromise."
"In contrast, Obama expanded the war in Afghanistan – which he considered to be a war of necessity – and put the Taliban on the defensive. But the US will begin to withdraw troops after 2014, without having defined a political solution in line with its interests."
"Meanwhile, America’s strategic partnership with Pakistan, where Obama won a significant symbolic victory by eliminating Osama bin Laden, is in tatters."
"US-Pakistan relations have regressed to their level before September 11, 2001, with mutual distrust minimizing cooperation."
"In fact, in all of the strategic challenges to US security that Obama inherited – Iran, North Korea, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – he has made virtually no significant political gains."
Notwithstanding Obama’s skillful response to the Arab Spring – the only strategic surprise that he has faced as president – his credibility in the Muslim world has steadily declined.
He has failed to deliver on the key promise of his Cairo speech in 2009: “to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world.”
"Moreover, Obama’s efforts to improve relations with Russia – embodied in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) – did not lead to a genuine “reset” in bilateral ties, largely because an increasingly Soviet-style Russian leadership distrusts a US establishment that still regards Russia as a foe."
"And the US-China relationship has deteriorated, with America seeking to manage China’s rise strategically – for example, through regional trade agreements and an enhanced military presence in Asia."
"On multilateral issues, Obama’s performance is equally unimpressive."
After committing to a 17% reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions by 2020 – and despite his declaration that he would not tolerate inaction in this area – he simply stopped raising the issue after the Republicans’ sweeping victory in the November 2010 mid-term elections.
"Likewise, domestic pressure has caused Obama to neglect trade issues."
The US is largely responsible for the failure of the Doha Round of global trade talks.
Obama’s one significant foreign-policy breakthrough has been to release the US from the grip of the “global war on terror.”
"Jettisoning the Manichean rhetoric of that “war” allowed the US to regain the political legitimacy that former President George W. Bush had lost, without diminishing its strategic credibility."
"After the Vietnam War, Jimmy Carter hoped to make a break with established US policy. But his administration’s actions – including serious blunders in Iran and Afghanistan – made the US appear weak and indecisive."
"While Obama’s policies have not weakened America’s international standing, they also have not led to achievements comparable to Richard Nixon’s rapprochement with China, largely owing to what might be described as the dogmatic pragmatism that underlies them – an emphasis on avoiding the worst, rather than on striving for the best."
"Moreover, Obama has been confronted with significant constraints, including the global economic crisis, domestic political polarization, a hostile Congress, and the rise of emerging powers that need the US but are unwilling to accept its dominance."
"As a result, he has failed to change strategic realities by, for example, reconciling America’s broader interests with those of Iran (a declared enemy), Pakistan (a “frenemy”), and Israel (a key ally)."
"To be sure, Obama faces a more complex diplomatic and strategic environment than Nixon faced in the 1970’s."
"Unstable coalitions in Iran prevent any substantive negotiations between the two countries, while political fragmentation in Pakistan significantly hinders US policy there."
"And the fragility of Israel’s ruling coalition, combined with strong congressional support for Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, makes it difficult to influence the country’s policies, despite Israel’s significant impact on US strategy in the Arab world."
But Obama has also struggled to define the terms of a possible grand bargain.
"Any agreement with Iran would require consent from Israel and the Gulf countries, which do not share the same objectives."
"And the US cannot reach an accord with Pakistan without India’s consent, which America would be unable to force, especially given that it relies on India to counterbalance China’s growing clout in Asia."
"With Israel, the terms are ostensibly simpler: in exchange for a stronger US security guarantee, Israel would accept the establishment of a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders. But Israel is also a crucial domestic political topic in the US; indeed, any distancing from Israel is unacceptable to most Americans."
"While Obama’s first term could not be called a foreign-policy disappointment, his achievements – although not trivial – have been limited."
"If he wins a second term, he is likely to find it increasingly difficult to win by playing not to lose."
America’s Groucho Marxist
LONDON – Groucho Marx has always been my favorite Marxist.
"One of his jokes goes to the heart of the failure of the ideology – the dogmatic religion – inflicted on our poor world by his namesake, Karl."
"“Who are you going to believe,” Groucho once asked, “me, or your own eyes?”"
"For hundreds of millions of citizens in Communist-run countries in the twentieth century, the “me” in the question was a dictator or oligarchy ruling with totalitarian or authoritarian powers."
It didn’t matter what you could see with your own eyes.
You had to accept what you were told the world was like.
Reality was whatever the ruling party said it was.
"The designated successor to Mao Zedong in China, Hua Guofeng, raised this attitude to an art form."
He was known as a “whateverist.”
The Party and people should faithfully follow whatever Mao instructed them to do.
Groucho posed two insuperable problems for the “whateverists” of communism.
"First, your own eyes and your reason would surely tell you before long that the communist idyll – the withering away of the state and the triumph over need – would never come."
"Communism, like the horizon, was always just beyond reach."
"It would be interesting to know how many of those at Beijing’s Central Party School – the party’s main educational institute – believe that the Chinese state is about to wither away, or ever will."
The second application of Groucho’s question was that citizens of most Communist countries soon learned that the loss of freedom that they suffered was not compensated by greater prosperity or a higher quality of life.
"The more that Russians, Poles, Czechs, and others saw of the life-style in the Western democracies, the more they questioned their own system."
In his magisterial book
"So, in the political sphere, reason has trumped both faith in an unattainable goal and self-delusion about the consequences of its pursuit."
"Authoritarian party-states, such as China and Vietnam, survive, but not through commitment to communism."
Their legitimacy depends on their ability to deliver economic growth through state-managed capitalism.
"Democracies, of course, allow people to use their reason to make choices based on the evidence of their own eyes."
"When you don’t like a government, you can turn the rascals out without overthrowing the whole system."
"Change can be made in an evolutionary, rather than a revolutionary, way."
"But no one should think that debate in democracies is always based on reason, or that democracy necessarily makes people more rational."
Sometimes reason does prevail.
"This is what appeared to happen in the last Indian election, and the election in the United States of President Barack Obama was also plainly a supremely rational moment."
But reason does not seem to be getting much of a hearing during the current health-care debate in the US.
"Outsiders, even admirers, have often wondered how the most globalized country in the world – a continent inhabited by people from every land – can be so irrationally insular on some issues."
We scratch our heads about America’s gun laws.
"We were astonished during President George W. Bush’s first term at the administration’s hostility to science, reflected in its stance on climate change and Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution."
The opposition to health-care reform is a similar cause of bemusement.
We know that despite its great wealth – and its groundbreaking medical research – America’s health-care system is awful.
It is hugely expensive.
Its costs overwhelm workplace health-insurance schemes.
The poor go unprotected.
Too many of the sick are untreated.
Overall health statistics are worse than those in comparable countries.
Yet Obama’s attempts to reform health care have run into hysterical opposition.
"His proposals would lead, it is said, to the state murdering the elderly."
"They would introduce Soviet communism into the US – just like what apparently exists in Canada and Britain, with their state-sponsored health systems."
Communism in Toronto and London?
"Or just better, cheaper, more reliable health care for all?"
Reason seems to be having a hard time of it in the US just now.
Maybe it’s no coincidence that Groucho Marx was an American citizen.
But surely the way a society cares for its sick and needy and elderly is sufficiently important to deserve serious and thoughtful argument based on what we really can see with our own eyes rather than on uninformed partisan prejudice.
America’s Growth in the Decade Ahead
"CAMBRIDGE – Although the strength of the US economy in 2010 remains uncertain, it is important to look ahead to its likely performance in the coming decade."
"The rise of GDP over the next ten years will reflect the very positive effect of the eventual recovery from the current deep downturn, combined with a below-trend rise in the economy’s potential output at full employment."
"When I add up all the key components, I conclude that the coming decade’s annual growth is likely to be about 1.9%, roughly the same as the average rate over the past ten years."
"To understand why, let’s start with the cyclical recovery."
"I’ll make the optimistic but plausible assumption that the economy will fully recover over the next decade, lowering the unemployment rate from the current 10% to about 5%."
"That return to full employment will also reduce the number of people who, discouraged that no jobs exist for those with their skills, have stopped looking for work (and are therefore not counted as unemployed)."
"That cyclical recovery of employment will cause GDP to rise by about 13% over the next decade, or an average of 1.2% per year."
"That represents a substantial turnaround from the past decade, when the unemployment rate rose from 4% to 10% and the labor-force participation rate fell from 67% to 65%, reducing GDP by about 1.6% per year."
The full rise in GDP will combine the 1.2%-per-year cyclical rebound with the increase in potential full-employment GDP.
"The growth of potential GDP will reflect the structural rise of the labor force, the increase in the capital stock, and the improvement in multifactor productivity (i.e., the change in the output that results from improvements in technology rather than from increases in labor and capital.)"
"Although there are uncertainties about each of these components of growth, their performance in the coming years is unlikely to be as good as it was in recent decades."
Slower population growth and a demographically driven decline in the labor-force participation rate will reduce employment growth.
"Indeed, the US Department of Labor recently predicted that the labor force will grow by only 8% between 2008 and 2018, down from 12% in the previous ten years."
That growth of the labor force will raise potential GDP by only about 0.5% per year.
"Although the capital stock will benefit from a higher household saving rate, the increase will be offset by more government “dissaving” as budget deficits remain high."
A reluctance of foreign investors to keep accumulating dollar assets will cause a smaller capital inflow from the rest of the world.
"Finally, the change in potential GDP will depend on what happens to the rate of change of multifactor productivity – that is, the change in output that results from changes in technology and production processes."
"According to the OECD, US multifactor productivity rose at a relatively stable annual rate of about 0.75% from 1985 to 2000, and then jumped to 1.4% per year from 2001 through 2008."
There is no way to know whether the rate of growth of multifactor productivity will remain at its current level or will revert to the pre-2000 pace.
"Assuming slower growth in the labor force than in the past decade, no rise in productivity due to capital accumulation, and a decline in multifactor productivity growth to its pre-2000 average implies that annual potential GDP growth will be only 1.4%."
"Combining these conservative assumptions about potential GDP with the effect of the cyclical rebound – an estimated 1.2% annual rise in real GDP – would produce real GDP growth at an average annual rate of 2.6%, which would be significantly higher than the 1.9% rate in the decade ending in 2009."
But not all of the extra output produced over the next decade will remain in the US.
"If the trade deficit is reduced by 3% of GDP between now and the end of the decade, the implied rise in exports and decline in imports would reduce output available for US consumption and investment by about 0.3% per year."
The effect of a decline in the dollar over the coming decade could be equally important.
"If the real trade-weighted value of the dollar falls by 25% over the coming decade, and the full effect of that dollar decline is reflected in import prices, the increased cost of imports would reduce the growth of US real incomes by about 0.4% a year."
"These two international effects would leave annual net growth of real goods and services available for US consumption and investment – both domestically produced and imported – at just 1.9%, implying no change compared to the past decade."
"During those years, the rise in the volume of net imports just balanced the effect of the dollar’s fall on the total cost of imports."
"As a result, the rise in the real value of goods and services available for US consumption and investment was the same as the rise of real GDP."
"There are, of course, serious downside risks to this forecast, especially if the fiscal deficit remains high or adverse tax policies depress the rise in productivity."
The government should take the weak ten-year projection as a warning and a reason to devote policies to reducing fiscal deficits and strengthening incentives for growth.
Gun Control After Newtown
"NEW YORK – The brutal murder of 20 children and seven adults in Newtown, Connecticut, shakes us to the core as individuals and requires a response as citizens."
The United States seems to reel from one mass gun killing to another – roughly one a month this year alone.
Easy access to guns in the US leads to horrific murder rates relative to other highly educated and wealthy societies.
America needs to find a better way.
Other countries have done so.
"Between the mid-1970’s and the mid-1990’s, Australia had several mass shootings."
"After a particularly horrible massacre in 1996, a new prime minister, John Howard, declared that enough was enough."
"He instituted a severe crackdown on gun ownership, and forced would-be gun owners to submit to a rigorous application process, and to document why they would need a gun."
"Conditions for gun ownership in Australia are now very strict, and the registration and approval process can take a year or more."
"Howard’s government also implemented a rigorous “buyback” policy, to enable the government to purchase guns already owned by the public."
The policy worked.
"While violent crime has not ended in Australia, murders are down, and, even more dramatically, there has not been a single mass shooting since 1996 in which three or more people died (the definition used in many studies of mass shootings)."
"Before the crackdown, there had been 13 such massacres in 18 years."
"Yet the US still refuses to act, even after this year’s string of shocking incidents: the massacre in a movie theatre in Colorado, an attack on a Sikh community in Milwaukee, another on a shopping mall in Oregon, and many more before the ruthless slaughter of first graders and school staff in Newtown."
"The gun lobby in the US remains powerful, and politicians are afraid to counter it."
"Given the shooting of then-Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in 2011, perhaps they even fear that they, too, might be targeted."
"There can be little doubt that some societies are more steeped in violence than others, even controlling for obvious factors like income levels and education."
"The US homicide rate is roughly four times that of comparable societies in Western Europe, and Latin America’s homicide rates are even higher than in the US (and dramatically higher than Asian countries at roughly the same income level)."
What accounts for staggeringly high rates in the US and Latin America?
American violence is rooted in history.
"The US and Latin American countries are all “conquest” societies, in which Europeans ruled over multi-racial societies."
"In many of these countries, including the US, the European conquerors and their descendants nearly wiped out the indigenous populations, partly through disease, but also through war, starvation, death marches, and forced labor."
"In the US and many Latin American countries, slaveholding fueled mass violence as well."
The slaves – and generations of their descendants – were routinely murdered.
The US also developed a particular populist belief that gun ownership constitutes a vital protection against government tyranny.
The US was born in a citizens’ revolt against British imperial power.
"The right of citizens to organize militias to fight government tyranny was therefore a founding idea of the new country, enshrined in the Second Amendment to the US Constitution, which declares that, because a country needs a well-regulated militia, the people have the right to bear arms."
"Since citizens’ militias are anachronistic, gun owners now use the second amendment merely to defend individual gun ownership, as if that somehow offers protection against tyranny."
"A reckless, right-wing Supreme Court has agreed with them."
"As a result, gun ownership has become perversely linked to freedom in the vast gun-owning American sub-culture."
"But, instead of protection of freedom, Americans nowadays are getting massive bloodshed and fear."
"The claim that gun ownership ensures freedom is especially absurd, given that most of the world’s vibrant democracies have long since cracked down on private gun ownership."
No tyrant has risen in Australia since Howard’s gun-control reforms.
"Simply put, freedom in the twenty-first century does not depend on unregulated gun ownership."
"Indeed, America’s gun culture is a threat to freedom, after the murder of a president, senator, and other public leaders, and countless assassination attempts against public officials over recent decades."
Yet US gun culture remains as pervasive as it is unrecorded.
"America reels from one shooting disaster to the next, and on nearly every occasion, politicians dutifully declare their continued devotion to unregulated gun ownership."
"Indeed, no one even knows how many guns Americans hold."
"The number is estimated to be around 270 million, or almost one per person on average."
"According to one recent poll, 47% of households have a gun at home."
"The shooting in Newtown was not only especially horrific and heartbreaking, but is also part of an increasingly common pattern – a specific kind of murder-suicide that has been carefully studied by psychologists and psychiatrists."
"Loners, often with paranoid tendencies, commit these heinous acts as part of their own suicide."
They use carefully planned and staged mass murders of innocents in order to take revenge on society and to glorify themselves as they take their own lives.
The perpetrators are not hardened criminals; many have no previous criminal record.
"They are pathetic, deranged, and often have struggled with mental instability for much of their lives."
They need help – and society needs to keep guns out of their reach.
"America has now suffered around 30 shooting massacres over the past 30 years, including this year’s deadly dozen; each is a gut-wrenching tragedy for many families."
"And yet, each time, gun owners scream that freedom will be eliminated if they are unable to buy assault weapons and 100-round clips."
The bloodbath in Newtown is the time to stop feeding this gun frenzy.
Australia and other countries provide models of how to do it: regulate and limit gun ownership to approved uses.
America’s G-Zero Moment
NEW YORK – The 2008 financial crisis marked the end of the global order as we knew it.
"In advance of the upcoming G-8 summit, it is impossible to overlook the fact that, for the first time in seven decades, the United States cannot drive the international agenda or provide global leadership on all of today’s most pressing problems."
"Indeed, the US has trimmed its presence abroad by refusing to contribute to a eurozone bailout, intervene in Syria, or use force to contain Iran’s nuclear breakout (despite strong Israeli support)."
"President Barack Obama officially ended the war in Iraq, and is withdrawing US troops from Afghanistan at a pace constrained only by the need to save face."
America is handing off the leadership baton – even if no other country or group of countries is willing or able to grasp it.
"In short, US foreign policy may be as active as ever, but it is downsizing and becoming more exacting about its priorities."
"As a result, many global challenges – climate change, trade, resource scarcity, international security, cyber-warfare, and nuclear proliferation, to name a few – are bound to loom larger."
"Welcome to the G-Zero world, a more turbulent, uncertain environment in which coordination on global policy issues falls by the wayside."
"Paradoxically, this new environment, though daunting, is less troublesome for the US; in fact, it provides fresh opportunities for the US to capitalize on its unique position. The G-Zero world is not all bad for the US – if it plays its cards right."
"Many residual strengths take on greater importance in such a world, and America remains the world’s only true superpower and its largest economy – still more than twice the size of China’s."
"Its defense expenditures represent nearly half the world total, and exceed those of the next 17 countries combined."
"The dollar remains the world’s reserve currency, and investors’ scramble into US government debt at every peak in the crisis since 2008 has underscored America’s safe-haven status (even in crises that America caused)."
"Likewise, the US continues to lead in entrepreneurship, research and development, higher education, and technological innovation."
"Moreover, it is now the world’s largest natural-gas producer and calorie exporter, which has reduced its vulnerability to price shocks or food shortages."
"No country rivals America’s promotion of the rule of law, liberal democracy, transparency, and free enterprise."
"While other countries certainly support these values, only the US has been willing, healthy, and big enough to ensure that they prevail."
"So, as America curtails its global leadership, it will find itself in more demand."
"Consider Asia, for example.&nbsp;As China’s economic importance and regional influence grows, its neighbors are seeking to deepen ties with the US. Japan, Australia, Indonesia, and Taiwan have all recently closed trade and security-related deals with the US."
"Even Burma has gotten on board, resuming diplomatic engagement with the US while trying to work its way out of China’s shadow."
"In other words, in a G-Zero world, an increasingly aggressive global environment makes the US all the more appealing to countries seeking to hedge their bets.&nbsp;As a result, the US has an opportunity to act more precisely in its own interests."
"Supplying less leadership allows the US to weigh opportunity costs before taking action, and to select the issues and circumstances that suit it the best.&nbsp;In this environment, military intervention in Libya does not necessitate the same in Syria."
The extent to which the US will capitalize on these opportunities remains to be seen.
"In fact, America’s short-term advantages pose the biggest obstacle to its long-term outlook."
"Call this the “safe-haven curse”:&nbsp;as long as the US remains the safest port in any storm, it faces no immediate pressure to address its weaknesses."
"For example, for all of the hand-wringing about America’s national debt, investors will continue to loan the US money."
"Over the long term, however, US policymakers must make steady progress in restoring confidence in the nation’s fiscal health by cutting politically sacred programs like social security, Medicare, and defense."
"Officials will have to put aside short-term motives and party orthodoxy to bolster America’s aging infrastructure, reform its education and immigration systems, and pursue long-term fiscal consolidation."
America’s advantages in the G-Zero world afford it the chance to invest in the future.
"But, by cushioning against sufficiently calamitous risks, the same advantages allow the US to procrastinate."
"American politicians need to recognize the new G-Zero reality and rebuild America’s domestic sources of strength, even if only incrementally.&nbsp;If they do, the US will have the vigor and flexibility to shape the next world order."
"America’s political system usually works well in crises.&nbsp;But, thanks to its residual advantages in a leaderless world, the US need not rely on a crisis to precipitate action."
It need only seize the G-Zero moment.
America Shoots Itself
"One of the casualties of the war against terrorism--or, rather, of the way the United States is conducting the war--is the US influence in promoting human rights worldwide."
"For the international human rights movement, this is a severe setback."
"For more than a quarter of a century, ever since advancing human rights internationally became an explicit and avowed goal of US foreign policy under President Jimmy Carter, American influence played a leading role in mitigating abuses."
"The consequences were most profound in what were the countries of the Soviet empire, but they extended to other regions as well."
Even where the US supported regimes that committed grave violations of rights--or served as an apologist for them because other national interests took precedence--it was often possible for the human rights movement to embarrass Washington by making it the surrogate villain for its clients' abuses.
"In the 1980's, this approach focused attention on abuses in conflict-ridden Central America and in Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which the Reagan Administration favored in its struggle with America's enemy, Ayatollah Khomeini's Iran."
It thus sometimes achieved indirectly what could not be done directly: the leveraging of American influence to promote human rights.
But America's capacity to promote human rights in other countries has never been weaker than now.
"One reason is the tremendous increase in anti-Americanism since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001."
This is largely due to a widespread perception of American arrogance.
"Despite (or because of) its insistence that all who are not with America are against it, the Bush administration alienated many who previously counted themselves either as friends of the US or did not take sides."
"At the same time, rising anti-Americanism preceded the US response to the terrorist attacks."
"The Bush team was outspoken in its hostility to a range of international agreements, from the Kyoto Treaty to reduce global warming to the establishment of the International Criminal Court."
Whatever goodwill towards the US prevailed after September 11 was quickly squandered.
"The Bush administration proclaimed a national security policy that insists that America provides the only sustainable model for national success, and asserted its right to engage in unilateral, preemptive military strikes."
"It treated the UN Security Council with disdain in its rush to war in Iraq, invoking justifications that have not stood up to scrutiny."
"Since then, it has continued to insist that its arguments for invading Iraq are beyond criticism, while making a mess of the postwar administration by refusing to share authority."
The other major reason that America is losing its effectiveness as a promoter of human rights is a widespread perception of hypocrisy.
"Even before the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, America's image as a rights proponent had been tarnished, particularly in Europe, by its continued practice of capital punishment and, to a lesser degree, by its high incarceration rate--approximately seven times the average in the European Union's fifteen member countries."
"Since September 2001, the cause for concern has grown dramatically."
"Much international attention has focused on the USA Patriot Act's sanctioning of grave violations of civil liberties, and on the subsequent treatment of thousands of immigrants--particularly south Asian Muslims--who have faced secret detention and deportation."
"Above all, the rest of the world has looked on with alarm as the US holds more than 600 men at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba without access to family or counsel, and without prospect of an impartial hearing or trial."
"In some instances, reports of rights violations in the US are exaggerated."
"But this is an inevitable consequence of the Bush administration's own haughty manner, with leading spokespersons, such as Attorney General John Ashcroft, proclaiming their own righteousness in leading the effort to abrogate rights."
"Ashcroft is much less known internationally than Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, but he is an even match in arousing dislike for the US among those who do know him."
"Unfortunately, there is no ready substitute for the US as a force for advancing human rights internationally."
"The UN has been useful as a forum for adopting standards, but its machinery for seeking compliance with those standards is weak and has been badly compromised over the years by its failure to address grotesque abuses."
The choice of Libya to chair the UN Human Rights Commission adds insult to injury.
"Some European governments have evolved strong human rights polices but, for a variety of reasons, they have been unable, individually or collectively, to exert the influence of the US."
"Fortunately, while this is likely to remain true for the foreseeable future, the international human rights movement is not completely without resources."
"Its own prestige is high: groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are respected voices, to whom many governments feel obliged to pay attention."
There is also the promise of new institutions.
"In cases of extreme rights abuses, the chance that an international criminal tribunal will ultimately sit in judgment of those principally responsible is growing, thereby becoming a deterrent to would-be tyrants elsewhere."
America should take note.
America Should Not Lower the Nuclear Threshold
President Bush has pushed stopping the spread of nuclear weapons to the top of the international agenda.
"Ironic, then, that America's nuclear weapons development program may promote the very proliferation it seeks to prevent, as US Senator Dianne Feinstein explains."
"With the world's focus on the debate over Iraq, the war on terror, and the Bush administration's doctrine of unilateral preemption, the American government's new emphasis on the utility of nuclear weapons has not received the attention it deserves."
"This is unfortunate, as this exploration of new uses for nuclear weapons represents a revolutionary shift in US national security policy."
"Today, the world faces unprecedented challenges at the nexus of terror and weapons of mass destruction."
"With both North Korea and Iran openly pursuing nuclear ambitions and a potential nuclear arms race in South Asia, it is critical that America provide leadership, in both word and in deed, to reduce the risks and the role of nuclear weapons throughout the world."
"Instead, the Bush administration seems intent on doing just the opposite."
"Many of the actions of the American administration, and much of the US government's rhetoric, may actually be increasing the threat from nuclear weapons rather than making the world safer."
The Bush administration's January 2002 Nuclear Posture Review signaled a major change in US nuclear policy by advancing a new triad that integrates nuclear weapons with conventional strike options and blurring the line between the use of conventional and nuclear weapons.
"It also specified scenarios in which the US might use nuclear weapons first, even against non-nuclear states, and called for a new generation of US nuclear warheads, including low yield or so-called ""mini-nukes."""
"The US has never had a no-first-strike policy, but it has likewise never had a policy such as that embodied in the Nuclear Policy Review."
"Today, under the terms of the ideas set out in that review, the US contemplates the first use of nuclear weapons, and seeks to integrate tactical battlefield nuclear weapons alongside conventional munitions."
"Despite efforts to downplay the significance of the Nuclear Posture Review since its publication, it remains, in my view, extremely provocative and dangerous."
"Earlier this year, at a hearing of the US Senate's Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, I asked Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, whose Department oversees America's research and development of nuclear weapons, whether the Bush administration wanted to develop new low-yield nuclear weapons."
Secretary Abraham said it did not; that his department was only studying adaptations of existing weapons.
"Yet, there should be no doubt that the Bush administration is beginning the research and development of new nuclear weapons."
"Just this year, a 10-year-old ban on the research and development of nuclear weapons below five kilotons--the bomb at Hiroshima was 15 kilotons--was eliminated."
"Pushed by the Bush administration, Congress authorized $21 million for the study and development of new nuclear weapons, including a 100-kiloton bunker buster, as well as tactical battlefield nuclear weapons."
"Moreover, the time to test readiness of the Nevada test site has been moved up from three years to two years, and funding has been provided to produce additional fissile material for new nuclear weapons."
I argued and voted against these new nuclear initiatives in the US Senate earlier this year.
"Clearly, the nuclear door is being reopened."
"For, by taking the steps called for in the Nuclear Posture Review--specifically, developing ""new capabilities...to defeat emerging threats,"" including ""extensive research and timely fielding of"
"This approach is not in America's national interest, nor is it consistent with American traditions and values."
"A first-use of nuclear weapons by the US should be unthinkable, and responding to a non-nuclear attack with nuclear weapons violates a central tenet of just war and US military tradition."
"Indeed, nuclear options should not be considered as an extension of conventional options."
Why?
Because this inevitably lowers the threshold for use.
"So, if the US develops nuclear weapons that blur the distinction between conventional and nuclear forces, the message this sends to the rest of the world must be considered."
I believe it is critical that the US set a very high international standard for nuclear restraint.
"If America does not, it may very likely encourage others to develop their own standards and their own nuclear arsenals."
That seems to be happening.
"Both India and Pakistan are nuclear powers, and the history of bloody warfare between them presents a major and ongoing security threat to South Asia."
"If either country adhered to the thinking embodied in the Bush administration's new nuclear policy, there would be little reason for each not to seek to integrate nuclear weapons even more deeply into their own contingency plans--and possibly use them."
"At a time when the US brands as ""evil"" certain countries based, in part, on their pursuit of nuclear arms and weapons of mass destruction, it must be especially careful in how it considers its own options and contingencies regarding nuclear weapons."
"If the US is not careful, our own new nuclear posture could provoke the very nuclear-proliferation activities we are seeking to prevent."
America’s Houses of Card
There are times when being proven right brings no pleasure.
"For several years, I argued that America’s economy was being supported by a housing bubble that had replaced the stock market bubble of the 1990’s."
But no bubble can expand forever.
"With middle-class incomes in the United States stagnating, Americans could not afford ever more expensive homes."
"As one of my predecessors as Chairman of the US President’s Council of Economic Advisers famously put it, “that which is not sustainable will not be sustained.”"
"Economists, as opposed to those who make their living gambling on stocks, make no claim to being able to predict when the day of reckoning will come, much less identifying the event that will bring down the house of cards."
"But the patterns are systematic, with consequences that unfold gradually, and painfully, over time."
There is a macro-story and a micro-story here.
"The macro-story is simple, but dramatic."
"Some, observing the crash of the sub-prime mortgage market, say, “Don’t worry, it is only a problem in the real estate sector.”"
"But this overlooks the key role that the housing sector has played in the US economy recently, with direct investment in real estate and money taken out of houses through refinancing mortgages accounting for two-thirds to three-quarters of growth over the last six years."
"Booming home prices gave Americans the confidence, and the financial wherewithal, to spend more than their income."
"America’s household savings rate was at levels not seen since the Great Depression, either negative or zero."
"With higher interest rates depressing housing prices, the game is over."
"As America moves to, say, a 4% savings rate (still small by normal standards), aggregate demand will weaken, and with it, the economy."
The micro-story is more dramatic.
"Record-low interest rates in 2001, 2002 and 2003 did not lead Americans to invest more – there was already excess capacity."
"Instead, easy money stimulated the economy by inducing households to refinance their mortgages, and to spend some of their capital."
"It is one thing to borrow to make an investment, which strengthens balance sheets; it is another thing to borrow to finance a vacation or a consumption binge."
But this is what Alan Greenspan encouraged Americans to do.
"When normal mortgages did not prime the pump enough, he encouraged them to take out variable-rate mortgages – at a time when interest rates had nowhere to go but up."
"Predatory lenders went further, offering negative amortization loans, so the amount owed went up year after year."
"Sometime in the future, payments would rise, but borrowers were told, again, not to worry: house prices would rise faster, making it easy to refinance with another negative amortization loan."
The only way (in this view) not to win was to sit on the sidelines.
All of this amounted to a human and economic disaster in the making.
Now reality has hit: newspapers report cases of borrowers whose mortgage payments exceed their entire income.
Globalization implies that America’s mortgage problem has worldwide repercussions.
The first run on a bank occurred against the British mortgage lender Northern Rock.
America managed to pass off bad mortgages worth hundreds of billions of dollars to investors (including banks) around the world.
"They buried the bad mortgages in complicated instruments, buried them so deep that no one knew exactly how badly they were impaired, and no one could calculate how to re-price them quickly."
"In the face of such uncertainty, markets froze."
Those in financial markets who believe in free markets have temporarily abandoned their faith.
"For the greater good of all (of course, it is never for their own selfish interests), they argued a bailout was necessary."
"While the US Treasury and the IMF warned East Asian countries facing financial crises ten years ago against the risks of bail-outs and told them not to raise their interest rates, the US ignored its own lectures about moral hazard effects, bought up billions in mortgages, and lowered interest rates."
"But lower short-term interest rates have led to higher medium-term interest rates, which are more relevant for the mortgage market, perhaps because of increasing worries about inflationary pressures."
"It may make sense for central banks (or Fannie Mae, America’s major government-sponsored mortgage company) to buy mortgage-backed securities in order to help provide market liquidity."
"But those from whom they buy them should provide a guarantee, so the public does not have to pay the price for their bad investment decisions."
Equity owners in banks should not get a free ride.
"Securitization, with all of its advantages in sharing risk, has three problems that were not adequately anticipated."
"While it meant that American banks were not hit as hard as they would otherwise, America’s bad lending practices have had global effects."
"Moreover, securitization contributed to bad lending: in the old days, banks that originated bad loans bore the consequences; in the new world of securitization, the originators could pass the loans onto others."
"(As economists would say, problems of asymmetric information have increased.)"
"In the old days, when borrowers found it impossible to make their payments, mortgages would be restructured; foreclosures were bad for both the borrower and the lender."
"Securitization made debt restructuring difficult, if not impossible."
It is the victims of predatory lenders who need government help.
"With mortgages amounting to 95% or more of the value of the house, debt restructuring will not be easy."
"What is required is to give individuals with excessive indebtedness an expedited way to a fresh start – for example, a special bankruptcy provision allowing them to recover, say, 75% of the equity they originally put into the house, with the lenders bearing the cost."
"There are many lessons for America, and the rest of the world; but among them is the need for greater financial sector regulation, especially better protection against predatory lending, and more transparency."
America’s Islamist Allies of Convenience
"NEW DELHI – In just one decade, the United States has intervened militarily in three Muslim-majority countries and overthrown their governments."
Now the same coalition of American liberal interventionists and neoconservatives that promoted those wars is pushing for punitive airstrikes in Syria without reflecting on how US policy has ended up strengthening Islamists and fostering anti-Americanism.
"Indeed, the last “humanitarian intervention” has clearly backfired, turning Libya into a breeding ground for transnational militants."
"As the intense US debate about President Barack Obama’s proposed use of military force highlights, the attack-Syria push is not about upholding America’s national interest."
"Rather, the desire to protect US “credibility” has become the last refuge of those seeking yet another war in the wider Middle East."
"If “credibility” were purged from the debate and the focus placed squarely on advancing long-term US interests, it would become apparent that an attack on Syria might not yield even temporary geopolitical gains."
"Beyond the short term, it would unleash major unintended consequences, potentially including an Iraq-style “soft” partition of Syria and the creation of a haven for extremists stretching across much of Islamist-controlled northern Syria and into the Sunni areas of Iraq."
"Indeed, an attack would most likely increase America’s reliance on unsavory Islamist rulers in countries ranging from Saudi Arabia and Qatar to Turkey and the United Arab Emirates."
"Some Arab monarchs have pledged to bankroll the US attack – an investment that they would easily recover, given that the war talk has already increased oil prices."
"Al Qaeda-type groups already have gained ground in the Middle East and North Africa as an unintended byproduct of US policies, creating fertile conditions for stepped-up international terrorism in the coming years."
"The US invasion and occupation of Iraq, for example, created a major opening for Al Qaeda, whose affiliates now represent the Sunni struggle against the Shia-dominated government."
"Likewise, regime change in Libya aided the rise of Al Qaeda-linked militants, leading to the killing in Benghazi of the US ambassador. A system based on sharia (Islamic law) has been imposed, human-rights abuses are legion, and cross-border movement of weapons and militants has undermined the security of Libya’s neighbors."
"Meanwhile, America’s support for the regimes in Yemen and Saudi Arabia has contributed to the rise of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula."
"In parts of southern Yemen, an Al Qaeda affiliate, Ansar al-Sharia, functions as a de facto government."
"In Syria, where sizable chunks of territory are already under Islamist control and the pro-Al Qaeda Al Nusra Front overshadows the US-backed Free Syrian Army, the Obama administration is staring at the bitter harvest of its previous policy choices."
Airstrikes now would merely make matters worse by undercutting the FSA’s grassroots legitimacy and aiding Islamist forces.
"Farther east, the US wants an “honorable” exit from Afghanistan – the longest war in its history – through a peace deal with the Taliban, its main battlefield opponent."
"In seeking to co-opt the Taliban – an effort that has resulted in the Taliban establishing what amounts to a diplomatic mission in Doha, Qatar – the US is bestowing legitimacy on a thuggish militia that enforces medieval practices in the areas under its control."
America’s dalliances with Islamist-leaning political forces – and governments – have been guided by the notion that the cloak of Islam helps to protect the credibility of leaders who might otherwise be seen as foreign puppets.
"That simply will not work, even in the short term."
"On the contrary, until the Egyptian army removed him from the presidency, the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi was coming to be seen by many as America’s man in Cairo."
"In the long term, the US will gain nothing – and risk much – by continuing to back oil sheikhdoms that fund Muslim extremist groups and madrasas from the Philippines and India to South Africa and Venezuela."
"By supporting Islamist rulers, the US is contributing to a trend evident from the Maghreb to the badlands of Afghanistan and Pakistan – Muslims killing Muslims."
American policy has also contributed to a growing conflict between Islamist and secular forces in Muslim countries.
"This is best illustrated by Turkey, where Obama has ignored Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s heavy-handed efforts to annul free speech and turn himself into a twenty-first-century Sultan."
"There and elsewhere, the US, motivated by the larger geopolitical goal of containing Shia Iran and its regional allies, has embraced Sunni rulers steeped in religious and political bigotry, even though they pose a transnational threat to the values of freedom and secularism."
"Moreover, the clash within Islam is likely to be destabilizing regionally and counterproductive to the interests of the free world."
"Against this background, Obama should heed the doctrine proposed in 1991 by General Colin Powell. The Powell doctrine stipulates that the US should use military force only when a vital national-security interest is at stake; the strategic objective is clear and attainable; the benefits are likely to outweigh the costs; adverse consequences can be limited; broad international and domestic support has been obtained; and a plausible exit strategy is in place."
"Given the US record since the doctrine was formulated, another criterion should be added: the main beneficiaries of military intervention are not America’s mortal enemies."
Drone War
"BRUSSELS – “Sometime they’ll give a war and nobody will come,” the American poet Carl Sandburg wrote hopefully in 1936."
"His sentiment seems more apt than ever nowadays, but not because humanity has turned pacifistic. Rather, wars are increasingly fought remotely, with drones – or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) – doing the killing."
"Under President Barack Obama, the number of drone strikes carried out by the United States has soared, with more than 300 UAV attacks reported in Pakistan alone."
"In March 2011, the US Air Force for the first time trained more pilots for drones than for any other purpose."
This raises serious ethical questions.
"With no military personnel risking their lives, UAVs make it easier to kill, and to justify war operations to the public at home."
"Moreover, a human being’s reticence to kill is inversely related to the distance between attacker and target."
"In the case of a pilot flying drones over Yemen by operating a joystick in Nevada, the threshold to pulling the trigger is dangerously low."
"Killing is just a part of the job, to be followed by bowling, perhaps, or a quiet evening at home."
"Meanwhile, the mere sound of drones terrorizes whole populations, indicating to enemies and civilians alike that they are being watched and might be attacked at any moment – which could well play into the hands of terrorist recruiters."
"From a legal and human-rights point of view, the US drone program is even more alarming."
"After all, countries such as Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia do not belong to declared war zones."
"Outside the context of war, in turn, state killings are legal only if they prove absolutely necessary to save lives. They must be conducted either in self-defense after an attack, or in anticipatory self-defense against an immediate threat, when taking time to discuss non-lethal alternatives is not feasible."
"More than a decade after September 11, America’s drone program does not fall into the first category of reactive self-defense."
"Likewise, there is no evidence that any presumed terrorist who was killed outside of official war zones in the last few years represented a threat so immediate to US citizens’ lives that preventive and premeditated killing was the only option."
"Unless US leaders prove otherwise in every case, American UAV attacks in countries like Pakistan or Yemen should be called what they are: extrajudicial killings."
"US State Department legal adviser Harold Koh disagrees, arguing that America is involved in a worldwide “armed conflict with Al Qaeda, as well as the Taliban and associated forces.”"
"So, Koh claims, drone attacks are part of a global war, fought both in declared war zones and non-war countries; therefore, they are legal."
"But, even under this adventurous assumption, human-rights issues arise."
The laws of war condone targeted killings only of “combatants” who “directly participate in hostilities.”
"The killings must be proportionate, strategically necessary, and publicly justified. Avoiding harm to civilians should be the top priority."
"At the slightest sign of illegality, an investigation must be conducted, offenders prosecuted, and victims compensated."
"The US drone program’s legal basis is entirely unclear, however."
"Given that most information about UAV activity is classified, it is impossible to know whether all drone targets directly participated in hostilities."
"And, while the Obama administration’s claim of zero or single-digit civilian fatalities may be true according to the official definition, it rests on the premise that any military-age male killed in a drone strike is a militant, unless intelligence posthumously proves otherwise."
"A recent report by the law schools at Stanford University and New York University concludes that, in reality, civilian casualties in Pakistan may have accounted for up to 75% of all UAV victims between 2008 and 2011."
"Others estimate a lower, but still alarming, rate of 30%."
The legal obligation of proportionality is clearly being violated.
Accountability is also being flouted.
"Drone operations are carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency, an organization whose activities are shrouded in secrecy."
"And, unlike military personnel, CIA agents enjoy extensive immunity, undermining international legal standards."
"Without increased transparency, to declare America’s UAV campaign legal is impossible, both in the context of war and outside of armed conflict."
"As long as the US keeps the rest of the world in the dark, illegal acts – including possible war crimes – may be committed with impunity."
"Just as citizens worldwide are demanding increased economic and financial accountability, more pressure must be placed on the US to either prove that its drone activities are necessary and legal, or to stop them immediately."
"Victims of UAV attacks, their families, and civil-society groups have begun to speak out against America’s questionable drone campaign, and to pursue legal action. Others should feel encouraged to follow suit."
"In the meantime, every drone strike will not only undermine human rights and international humanitarian law, but will also further widen a legal loophole that other governments and armed groups will not hesitate to exploit."
"The US drone program does not make the world a safer place; it creates an environment in which unlawful killings can happen virtually anywhere, at any time, violating the fundamental human right not to be arbitrarily deprived of one’s life."
America’s Locust Year
BERKELEY – It is hard right now to write about American political economy.
"Nobody knows whether the debt-ceiling tripwire will be evaded; if so, how; or what will happen if it is not."
"If no deal to raise the debt ceiling is reached by August 3, interest rates on United States Treasury bonds could spike, or they could remain stable, as investors decide they have other problems to worry about."
"Or the US Federal Reserve, the Peoples Bank of China (PBC), or both – or even some other body – could support the market."
"Or interest rates could rise if people expect a much weaker global economy – and, in a weaker global economy with no inflation, investors should be holding more US Treasuries, not fewer."
"Frankly, no one knows what legislative deal will be struck to raise the debt ceiling."
"All we know as of this writing is that a deal would probably involve cuts in near-term spending, meaning weaker growth and higher unemployment over the next 18 months."
"And we can assume that it would be repealed and replaced by something else come January 2013, either by a re-elected President Barack Obama, or by a new, Republican president."
"So, rather than talking about the US debt ceiling, let us think instead about all of the things that the debt-ceiling impasse has prevented the US government from doing during the past six months – all of the useful policies that might have been debated and enacted, but were not."
"The risks imposed by global warming, for example, have not gone away."
"The sooner the world starts preparing to deal with those threats, the better."
Another six months should not be lost.
The employment-to-population ratio in the US remains flat – mired at the very low levels to which it fell during the recession.
"With households desperately trying to rebuild their balance sheets, and with capital investment remarkably healthy, the only places to boost spending to restore capacity utilization and unemployment to normal levels are exports, government purchases, and construction investment."
But opportunities to pursue the necessary policies have not been grasped.
"Here, too, another six months should not be lost."
"Likewise, the US could have fulfilled its normal role as the conductor of the international economic orchestra."
"It has not, even as the European Union continues to respond inadequately to its own slow-moving solvency crises."
The mandarins of northern Europe continue to measure out a drip-feed of support with coffee spoons.
Another six months have been lost.
"America faces long-run and short-run problems: decaying infrastructure, weakening educational systems, and a dysfunctional health-care system that produces sub-standard outcomes at twice the cost of any other industrial country."
Solving any of these three problems would go a long way toward resolving the long-run financing imbalance between current tax rates and America’s long-run social-insurance promises that the debt-ceiling debate’s instigators supposedly want to address.
But the US government won’t address them.
"Six months that could have been spent boosting the long-run growth potential of the American economy through infrastructure investment, educational reform, or an overhaul of health-care financing – greatly easing America's long-run deficit and debt dilemmas in the process – have been lost."
"During the run-up to World War II, Winston Churchill, speaking in Parliament, lamented “the years that the locusts hath eaten” – the period during which preparatory action to face the great crisis of his day (the rise of Continental fascism) could have been taken, but was not."
"Over the past century – with the notable exception of the Great Depression – the US political system has been remarkably good at foreseeing crises long before they have happened, and at least setting the foundation for dealing with them when they have occurred."
"But so far in the third millennium, this skill – or simply run of luck – has deserted the US."
My view is that the problem would fix itself easily if only the Republican Party of Dwight D. Eisenhower could stage a comeback (though without Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy).
"It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that the problem is one not only for the US, but for the rest of the world as well."
"Since December 7, 1941, the world has in large part been able to rely on global governance by a somewhat-competent hyperpower."
That America may be gone for good.
"If it is, the world needs to develop other institutions for global management – and quickly."
America’s Misguided Immigration Debate
"A debate on immigration is beginning in the United States Senate, which will take up several proposals."
These include a hateful bill – which the House of Representatives has already approved – that provides for the construction of a wall along the US-Mexican border and makes unauthorized entry into the US a felony.
"The US Senate will also consider a bill co-authored by Senator Edward Kennedy and Senator John McCain, which proposes stronger border enforcement, a temporary workers program with a path to residency and citizenship, and legalization for people already in the US without papers."
Another idea is to require anyone in the US wanting to regularize their immigration status to go home and wait in line there.
"This last component is largely rhetoric; it is hard to imagine any Mexican already in the US voluntarily returning to, say, Zacatecas to wait patiently in line for a new visa."
President George W. Bush has been skirting the question ever since he committed himself to an immigration agreement with Mexico when he visited President Vicente Fox in Guanajuato almost exactly five years ago.
"Finally, and perhaps most importantly, there is Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter’s compromise proposal."
"Specter’s proposal also provides for reinforced security at the border, as well as a six-year non-renewable Temporary Workers Program without a path to residency, although it would allow unauthorized immigrants to remain in the US with a new, non-immigrant status."
"The latter status may or may not include a path to residency and citizenship; fudging the issue may be a negotiating tactic to avoid debate over whether this is a form of disguised amnesty (which, fortunately, to a certain extent, it is)."
What’s missing in the debate is the Latin American context.
There was a time when north-south migratory flows in the western hemisphere were limited to Mexico and the Caribbean.
"That changed in the 1980’s, when Central America’s civil wars sent hundreds of thousands of migrants thru Mexico to the US, and then in the 1990’s, when people fleeing violence in Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, and Ecuador also began searching for opportunity."
"Today, even Brazil, traditionally a country of immigration, has become one of emigration."
"Moreover, these migrants are no longer exclusively of rural origin, nor do they travel only to traditional areas in the US; they are, literally, everywhere."
"Their remittances contribute immensely to the economic welfare of their families, communities, and home countries’ economies."
"Thus, whatever immigration policy emerges in the US will have an enormous impact south of the Rio Grande well beyond Mexico."
"This will occur precisely at a time when Latin America is swerving left, with country after country drifting back to anti-American, populist stances: Venezuela in 1999, Bolivia last year, perhaps Mexico, Peru, and Nicaragua later this year."
"If the perception of further US hostility toward Latin America persists, the tilt toward an irresponsible, demagogic left will harden."
"The responsible left in Chile, Brazil, and Uruguay are an exception to the emerging rule set by Venezuela’s President Hugo Chávez."
The best way to accentuate the region’s growing anti-American sentiment is to try to close the US-Mexican border (which will be futile).
"Instead, the US should establish humane, secure, and legal mechanisms of temporary or permanent entry for people the American economy needs and wants, and it should work with, not against, governments in Latin America."
"Five years ago, Mexico’s President Vicente Fox tried to convince Bush that something had to be done before a nativist backlash in the US complicated its relations with Latin America and made goals such as a Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA) impossible."
"But matters have gotten worse: border tensions between the US and Mexico have grown, the proposed wall has rightly provoked indignation, more unauthorized immigrants than ever are entering the US, and the FTAA has collapsed."
"Bush must begin to use what political capital he has left to support enlightened immigration reform, along the lines of the Kennedy-McCain bill."
"He will never get a guest-worker program without Democratic support, which in turn is unlikely unless the White House supports access to a program for unauthorized immigrants already in the US that includes some type of path to residence and citizenship."
Mexico and the US must be sensitive to domestic political concerns in both countries.
"No immigration deal is feasible north of the border without addressing security matters; south of the border, there is no conceivable Mexican cooperation on border security or on a Temporary Workers Program if immigration reform ignores the nearly five million Mexican citizens without papers currently living in the US."
Mexico must act on what Fox has called “shared responsibility.”
"The best imaginable deal between the US and Mexico, or the best imaginable US immigration reform, will not eliminate the flow of undocumented migrants from Mexico and South America overnight."
"Mexico has to assume responsibility for regulating this traffic, which means more than sealing off its southern border."
"The government could, for example, double welfare payments to households whose male heads stay home, threaten to revoke land reform rights after years of absence in rural communities, and establish choke points on highways at the Tehuantepec Isthmus."
"Fox has said that he is willing to break with old Mexican taboos, but the Bush administration has never taken him up on it."
"That is unfortunate, because Fox will not be around forever."
"Immigration has always been an immensely complex and delicate issue inside the US, and now for Latin America as well."
"A window of opportunity opened at the beginning of Bush’s first term, and closed shut after the terrorist attacks of September 2001."
It is opening again and should be taken advantage of before it is too late.
Why Iran Won’t Budge
TEL AVIV – No one really believed that the latest round of international negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program would produce a breakthrough.
"So it was no surprise that itdid not, despite the concessions that were made at the meeting in Kazakhstan by the P5+1 (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, plus Germany)."
America’s belief that a harsh sanctions regime could coax Iran into a deal has proved – at least so far – to be unrealistic.
"Despite being isolated and ostracized, Iran has managed to gain some strategic breathing room with the help of countries like China, Russia, India, Syria, and Venezuela, allowing it to resist Western pressure."
"More important, even though the severe sanctions regime led by the United States is bound to be imperfect – it only hardens further Iran’s resistance to “America’s designs.”"
"To be sure, Iran’s alliances are vulnerable to erosion and, in the case of two staunch allies, Syria and Venezuela, to outright collapse."
"The end of Chavismo would threaten Iran’s vast interests in Venezuela and its considerable presence in the Andes, while the fall of the Assad dynasty would be a devastating blow to Iran’s regional strategy."
"Even so, Russia and China continue to take a much more lenient approach to Iran than Europe and the US have since the International Atomic Energy Agency’s report in November 2011 described in detail Iran’s activities in pursuing the capability to produce nuclear weapons."
"While the Western powers have embraced ever-harsher sanctions, Russia and China view Iran as a tool in their global competition with the US."
China’s Iranian interests boil down to economics.
"Bilateral trade stands at about $40 billion a year, and China is not only Iran’s largest customer for crude oil, but also a colossal investor – somewhere between $40 billion and $100 billion – in Iran’s energy and transport sectors."
"True, China cannot entirely overlook US pressure and the staunch opposition of its top oil supplier, Saudi Arabia, to Iran’s nuclear program."
"But, while China has supported the mandatory sanctions set by the United Nations Security Council, it has rejected the West’s unilateral measures."
"With bilateral trade worth only about $5 billion annually, Russia’s economic interests in Iran are fairly modest."
"But it fears Iran’s ability to cause trouble, particularly by stirring up unrest among Russia’s Muslim citizens."
"Moreover, America has refused to pay the Kremlin’s high price – curtailment of congressional human-rights legislation, repeal of Cold-War-era restrictions on Russian-US trade, and abandonment of plans for ballistic missile defense in Europe – for Russian support on Iran (or, for that matter, on any other trouble spot, such as Syria)."
The problem with the US drive to have key stakeholders join its anti-Iran crusade is that some of them live in neighborhoods where Iran is an important factor.
India is a case in point.
"India is certainly alarmed at the possibility of Iran developing nuclear weapons, not to mention its concern at the possible effects of Iran’s Islamist fundamentalism on Kashmiri Muslims."
"But its $14 billion in annual bilateral trade, and dependence on Iranian oil – many of India’s refineries have been built to run solely on Iranian crude – are key strategic considerations."
"Moreover, India needs Iran as an alternative trade and energy conduit to Central Asia, bypassing rival Pakistan, and also as a hedge against an uncertain future in Afghanistan after America’s withdrawal in 2014."
"As a result, India’s policy mirrors China’s: it has aligned itself with mandatory international sanctions, but has abjured voluntary Western financial restrictions."
"The best one can expect is that India continues to act at the margin –&#160;for example, by reducing dependence on Iranian oil while increasing imports from Saudi Arabia, already its largest supplier of crude."
"The equivocal nature of Iran’s alliances, however, can be a mixed blessing."
"Yes, a harsh sanctions regime might still gain additional supporters, but an Iran with its back against the wall would probably be even more obstinate in its nuclear drive."
"After all, Iraq was an easy target in the first Gulf War precisely because it had abandoned its nuclear program, and possessed no weapons of mass destruction."
"Similarly, Libya’s Muammar el-Qaddafi exposed himself to a NATO onslaught by relinquishing his WMDs."
"By contrast, North Korea shows that defiance, rather than accommodation, is a strategy that works."
"That is why Syria, with North Korean assistance, tried to develop a nuclear program (presumably destroyed by Israel’s officially unacknowledged “Operation Orchard” in 2007).Iran will not consider abandoning its nuclear insurance policy unless a broad agenda is agreed upon that addresses Iran’s concerns as a regional power and secures the immunity of its Islamist regime from American actions."
Albert Einstein’s definition of insanity as “doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results” could be applied to America’s Iran policy.
"The diplomacy of sanctions, ostracism, and brinkmanship has failed resoundingly."
"As Iran’s uranium-enrichment and other weapons-development activities continue unabated, the US needs to make a break with the old rules of engagement."
America’s Misplaced Deficit Complacency
"CAMBRIDGE – The United States still faces a dangerous fiscal deficit, but one might not know it from the complacency that dominates budget discussions in Washington."
"Regarded as an urgent problem until recently, the federal deficit is now being placed on the back burner of American politics."
"The shift in thinking was triggered by the revised deficit forecasts recently published by the Congressional Budget Office, the independent technical agency responsible for advising Congress on budget issues."
"According to the CBO’s report, the US fiscal deficit will decline from 7% of GDP in 2012 to 4% in 2013."
"This reduction reflects the cuts in government spending on defense and non-defense programs mandated by the budget “sequester” that took effect in March, as well as the rise in revenue caused by higher rates for income and payroll taxes since the end of 2012."
"More striking is the CBO’s projection that the deficit will continue to decline rapidly, reaching just 2.1% of GDP in 2015, before rising gradually to just 3.5% of GDP in 2023, the end of the CBO’s official forecast period."
That path of deficits implies that the government debt/GDP ratio will remain at about the current level of 75% for the next ten years.
"Unfortunately, these headline-grabbing numbers are not likely to be borne out in reality; indeed, even the CBO does not believe that they represent what will occur."
"Instead, these official forecasts represent a “baseline” scenario that the CBO is required to present."
The CBO’s “baseline budget” assumes that all of the deficit-reducing features in current law will remain unchanged.
"These include, for example, an old legislative requirement that payments to physicians in the government’s Medicare program be reduced sharply in future years, a requirement that Congress has voted each year to “postpone.”"
"In order to provide better guidance, the CBO presents an “alternative fiscal scenario,” in which such very unlikely features are removed from the forecast."
"The alternative forecast implies that the annual budget deficit at the end of ten years will be back up to 4.7% of GDP, with the debt/GDP ratio at 83% and rising."
And those estimates are based on the optimistic assumption that the economy will have returned gradually to full employment with low inflation and moderate interest rates.
